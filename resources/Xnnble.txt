The April 6, I960, edition of "Tbe New York 
Tines" newspaper contained a full-page 
advertisement captioned, "What is Really 
Happening in Cuba, " placed by the FPCC. 

This advertisement announced the formation 
of the FPCC in New York, New York, and 
declared the FPCC intended to promulgate 
"the truth about revolutionary" Cuba to 
neutralize the distorted American press. 

"The New York Times" edition of January 
11, 1961, reported that at a hearing con- 
ducted before the United States internal 
Security Subcommittee on January 10, 19SI, 
Dr. CHARLES A. SANTQS-B’JCH identified 
himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of 
the FPCC. He also testified that he and 
TABER obtained funds from the Cuban 
Government which were applied toward the 
cost of the afore-mentioned advertisement. 

On May 16, I9S3, a second source advised 
that during the first two years of the 
FPCC's existence there was a struggle 
between the Communist Party fCP) and the 
Socialist Workers Party (SV/pj elements to 
exert their power within the FPCC and 
thereby influence FPCC policy. However, 
during the past year this source observed 
there has been a successful effort by 
FPCC leadership to minimize the role of 
these and other organizations in the FPCC 
so that today their influence is negligible'. 

On May 30, 1963, a third source advised 
that the national headquarters of the FPCC 
is located in Room 329 at 799 Broadway,

Few York, New York. /iccordlng to this 
source, the position of the National Office 
Director v.'as created in the fall of 1952 
and was filled by VINCENT "TED 1 ' 1£E, who 
now formulates FPCC policy. This source 
observed that LEE has followed a course 
of entertaining and accepting the cooperation 
of many other organizations. Including the 
CP and the SV.’P, when he had felt it would 
be to his personal benefit as well as the 
FPCC’s. LEE has Indicated to this source 
that he has no intention of permitting FPCC 
policy to be determined by any other organ- 
ization. LEE feels that the FPCC should 
advocate resumption of diplomatic relations 
between Cuba and the United States and 
support the right of Cubans to manage their -- 
revolution without interference from other* 
nations but not support the Cuban revolution 
per se. . 

The CP and the SV.'P have been designated ~ : ’

LEE KAF.VEY OSWALD 


The President’s Commission, by letter dated April 7, 
1964, requested investigation be conducted to determine the 
source of the funds used to pay for an advertisement appearing 
in "The Dallas Horning News" on November 22, 1963. Certain 
information concerning thia advertisement appears on pages 684 
to 721 of the report of Special Agent ROBERT P. GEMBERLING 
dated December 10, 1963, at Delias, Texas. 


On April 20, 1964, Hr. J03EFEI P. GRIN NAN, 811 Wilson- 
Building, who resides at 4640 Southern, Dallas, Texas, and is 
employed as an independent oil operator, advised he had 
solicited funds which had been used to pay for the advertise- 
ment Which appeared in "The Dallas Horning News", on November 22, 
1963. This full-page advertisement was signed by the American 
Fact-Finding Committee, BERNARD WEISSMAN, Chairman. GRINNAN 
said he could thtnk of four individuals who contributed sonve- 
where aroml $1,500.00, "give or taXe a hundred", which was used 
to pay for the advertisement in "The Dallas Morning News"# 

He said that he had become acquainted with LARRIE 
SCHMIDT, a friend of EERNARD WEISSMAN, at a meeting of an 
organization called the "Young Americans for Freedom". He 
said LARRIE SCHMIDT and BERNARD WEISSMAN were soldier friends, 
having served in the Army together, and through LARRIE SCHMIDT 
he became acquainted with BERNARD W T EISSMAN. LARRIE SCHMIDT , 
wanted to protest the visit of president KENNEDY to Dallas on 
November 22, 1963, in a dignified way; therefore, they got 
. ’ together and LARRIE SCHMIDT wrote the advertisement with some 
suggestions by GRINNAN. GRINNAN stated he did not write out 
anything When the advertisement was being written. He said 
the four contributors for the advertisement read the advertise- 
ment before publication. 

. GRINNAN stated that the American Fact-Finding 

Ccmunittoo was a paper name only and that no organization ,•

sponsored this advertisement, other than the American Fact-Finding 
Committee, Which name they mane up. Ke said that if anyone com- 
posed the American Fact-Finding Committee it was himself, LARRIE 
SCHMIDT, and-, a fellow named BILL from Baltimore, Maryland, who 
was a friend of LARRIE SCHMIDT and BERNARD WEISSMAN. He said he 
was pretty sure that BERNARD WEISSMAN tooX the advertisement to 
"The Dallas Morning News" and made arrangements for its publi- 
cation. Ho said they intended no personal harm to come to the 
President. 


Regarding the source of the funds to pay for the 
advertisement, he said he was reluctant to give the names of ■*: 
the contributors, because he did not want to hurt anyone. He 
said he desired to contact these contributors, who in turn may 
have solicited funds from other sources, prior to maXing these 
names available • * 

Ee was told that the President's Commission on the 
Assassination of President KENNEDY had specifically requested 
he be interviewed to determine the source of the funds used to 
pay for "The Dallas Morning News" advertisement. He stated he 
would contact the contributors to determine if they had any ob- 
jection to the release of their names, and would call the inter- 
viewing Agents on April 21, 1964. 

On Arril 22, 1964, JOSEPH P. GP INMAN advised by tele- 
phone that he had not contacted all the contributors to "The * 
Dallas Morning News" advertisement on November 22, 1963, con- 
sisting of a full page signed by American Fact-Finding Committee, 
BERNARD WEISSMAN, Chairman, but would do so and would advise of 
the outcome of his contacts on April 23, 1964. * 

m 

On April 23, 1964, at 3«15 P.M., Mr. JOSEPH P. GRINNAN 
advised by telephone that he did not desire to be interviewed <n 
April 23* 1364, because he wanted to consult with his lawyer. 
Doctor ROBERT MORRIS , Who is currently in the race for the Re- 
publican nomination for the United States Senate. He said 
Doctor' MORRIS was believed to be in Amarillo, Texas, and would* 
be jL Dallas on April 24, 1964.’ Eo said that after consulting 
witlj Doctor MORRIS ha would contact the. Dallas Office of ^the ' ^ 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. ' • . ‘

Dear Mr Hoover, 


r V ,f 


■ * 1 J r • i*': - 

*f \ ' J" - 


. First I*d like to Thank you lor having Mr Chuck Harding > ' 

one of your agents in Atlanta Contacting me about the recent letter I wrote 
you. Conserning my Husband. He assured me my Husband could in no ... 
way be involved. And it was only my Imagination I accepted this. Then 
later approx 2 weeks he come back to see me and drove me to work. Perhaps 
I couldbe wrong but I felt I had made him angry. As I’m a person that 
speaks very direct. He wanted to know why I hadn’t called this office in 
Atlanta. I told him I had on several occaision talked with the Police and 
had even called and talked to a Detective on the Car & Thef Squad. I told 
him of other things And that on 26th Nov I was at the House where my Husband 
was staying And that he had a woman in the house with him I was doing as I 
thought a good deed as my husbands family was wanting to get in contact with 
him And my husband was outside hollowing Jack Call the Police. And I just 
made the statement you’ll not Call the Police to me with as much as there 
is going on at this House. Then on the 5th of Dec there was a warrant signed 
on me there were some 5 wittnesses I believe And the Outcome they had to ' 
tell the Judge they had’nt seen Anything they had signed there name to. But 
I’m not Conserned About Any of this for after a person has experenced so sy 
much of this as I have it just comes Natural And it does’nt bother you. But ls 
I do want you to know I was Sincere when I wrote to you. Also Mr Harding ( 
stated that when you start talking about the President And his assassination * 
this was a serious thing. I Agreed with him but I did’nt understand what he 

was talking about. For I thought of him as a Great Man. v * . - 

• 

But what I was so Conserned about was Ruby shooting Oswald. 
For with just a little Common sense this mans life Could have been saved. 

But I was’nt the least bit surprised when he was shot as I had made the - 
remark when they took him in he’d never live to go to trial. But enough 
of this getting back to Mr Harding lie ask me for a Picture of my husband 
. And before I gave it to him I ask him Could I have it back. He promised 
me I could have it back. I wrote him a letter thanking him and appolized 
in the event I had made him Angry. Then I wrote him a letter asking him 
.for my picture still no reply 3 or 4 wks ago I called him and he told me he’d 
•been busy I’m well aware that if he is’nt he should be. I’m not an unresonable 
, person but I’ve Carried that picture in my Wallet for the past 18 years. But 
he informed me I did’nt have to have the picture right now in a matter of 
speaking when he got ready its possible he’d send me my picture So I’ll 
not waste my time talking to him Anymore. I’m enclosing a self address

NOTE: 

This is the eighth letter to the Commission^ ' • 
concerning Mrs. Martin. '*<•.*' : V * V ' • 1 

We have had unsatisfactory dealings with her ■ ** ' ’ * v 
in the past and she recontly recorded or took verbatim * 
notes of a telephonic conversation with an Agent of our 
Dallas Office. In view of the possibility of embarrass- 
ment to the Bureau and to alert the field, SAC letter 
64-23 dated 4/23/C4 was immediately prepared for 
dissemination. • • •' * V 

Martiii has been described as a ^bright nut", and 
since the assassination has been conducting her own 
investigation. The enclosed communication. from Dallas 
•relates to a telephonic compJ aint *f rom Hill indicating 
she was contacted on 4/22/G4 by an unidentified woman in '*■ ' 

Oklahoma who was very persistent in questioning Hill

concerning the assassination. Hill states she was 
llkewise persistent and refused to furnish any information. ,* 
Hill stated the caller made some reference to either • - 

furnishing Information to Mark lane or that Lane was 
interested in information she was obtaining. As you are 
aware, Lane is the a n<1 espouser of communist 

causes who formerly reprC^de^tetfijeo Harvey Oswald’s mother. 
Hill was alongside the Presidential motorcade on 
11/22/63 when President Kennedy was assassinated. When she 
was initially interviewed she reported hearing one shot and 
seeing the President fall forward. She later. became 
somewhat controversial when Mark Lane publicly used a taped 
interview with her as evidence that more than three sh<jts*; 
were fired. Hill on relnterviow reported bearing fourito v.£ ; , 
six shots. ’ , . % V • -

. * • Reference memo Gauthier to Callahan 4-7-64. » ^ 

Staff members of the President's Commission and specialists o a; armed ^ 

services, Drs. Humes, Heany, Fink, Light and Olivia (ph.) attended a conference on ^ 

4-14-64 for the purpose of reviewing motion pictures and slides of the assassination site.'i 

Representatives of the Secret Service and the FBI were present to assist in projecting the^ 

film and the use of the scale model. . : 

■ ' •**5 

Dr. Humes, U. S. Navy Commander, who performed the autopsy on the 
President, appeared to lead the discussion throughout the 4-hour session. All of his _ 
associates were generally in agreement with previous findings of the Commission '‘as to 
where Shots 1, 2 and 3 approximately occurred. __ f * Iv A «1| 

y Vx 


The most revealing information brought out by the doctors 


ollows: 


1. That Shot 1 struck the President high in the right shoulder area, pene-. 
trating the torso near the base of the neck damaging the flesh of the throat but not tearing 
the throat wall. This bullet, according to the doctors, continued and entered Governor [j 
Connally’s right shoulder, emerging below the right nipple. The velocity of the missile],] 
according to the doctors apparently was snagged in the coat and shirt, eventually falling' ; 
out on Connally’s stretcher.. • _ > . . . •* ; ’ ’ 

s*. i • . * 

J 2. That Shot 2 struck the wrist of the Governor, continuing on ipto his thigh 

z 

> 3. That Shot 3 struck the right side of the President's head, carrying much 

bone and brain tissue away, leaving a large cavity. There is nothing controversial about 
where Shot 3 occurred inasmuch as the Zapruder movie indicates with mucli clarity where 
this happened. , R£C- 26 . . ,,) 7 , )f ., n - 

... * Heretofore it was the opinion of the Commission that Shot l^ad only hit the 
President, that Shot 2 had entered the Governor's right shoulder area penetrating his 
torso through the chest area emerging and again entering the wrist and on into his leg.

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

i*#- 

'.r T * V- . *; 


1 7 / Staff attorneys of the Commission extensively questioned the docFors con- 
cerninglneir conclusions and their views were made a matter of record by Attorney 
MelviivEisenberg. . . 7 * • - 

/ Mr. Eisenberg advised that Governor Connally would be in Washington on 

Tuesday, April 21, 1964, to assist the Commission in describing as to where the three 
shots occurred and that he, Eisenberg, would request that Shaneyfelt and Gauthier be 
available to assist them in handling visual aids while the Governors views are obtained 
» . * 1 ; ,\r ur\ ****•■ * 

' t Mr. Eisenberg also Inquired whether Special Agent Shaneyfelt of the FBI 
Laboratory, Special Agent John Howlett of Secret Service and Gauthier would be able to 
arrange for a^re -enactment of the shooting scene in Dallas using the data collected by the 
Commission; to make movies of the areas where each shot occurred using Zapruder’s * 
camera to Wave people simulate the positions of the occupants of the President’s car in a 
car similar to the one used by the President which would be furnished by Secret Service; 
to take ground measurements between the Texas Schoolbook Depository from each point 
where shots occurred to determine the distances between gun muzzle and target, etc. 

Mr. Eisenberg inquired as to whether I had any suggestions concerning his 
request. He was advised that of course the FBI would do whatever possible to assist in 
this matter; however, it was felt that inasmuch as he, Eisenberg, had a good working 
knowledge of what the Commission desiied it would appear to me to be to the advantage of 
the Commission if he, Eisenberg, would be present in Dallas to insure the development of 
the desired technical data. He and his immediate superior. Attorney Norman Redlich, 
agreed to this suggestion. Without saying as much, it was felt that considerable publicity 
will definitely stem from this type of operation in Dallas and a representative of the Cora 
mission should be present to handle the inquiries of the press concerning the fact that 
this was a Commission field operation and not an operation of the FBI or Secret Service 

Mr. Eisenberg stated he would make his proposal for this field trip known ic 
the members of the Commission recommending that the FBI and Secret Service assist the 
Commission’s legal staff in gathering 011 -sitc data relating to the assassination of 
President John F. Kennedy. 

RECOMMENDATION: None - for information only.

ADDENDUM:

• . . It is questionable what the Commission expects to gain 

by an additional re-enactment of the scene of the assassination, bearing 
In mind that Secret Service has already gone through this exercise at 
least once, and Inspector Gauthier made actual models of the assassination 
area. It is inevitable that there will be considerable publicity attendant 
to the proposed re -enactment of the scene. .' V'* 

A * - ■ 

• * ' • .* • 

' ■ 1 It is our opinion that it would b e undesirable for the FBI 
to become involved as the speed of the car T prote ction measures, etc. , 
were flic basic responsibilities "of Secret Service at the time. We would 
prefer not Iobecoine~ideiilifiec}^ : n}> the act ual sc ene and happenings at 
tlie^ss assliiation ln theTiTinds of thej?ubli£_ • - ; 

It is recommended that Inspector Malley advise Mr. Rankin 
that this proposal appears to be without merit; that the FBI has done its 
utmost to be of assistance by providing models of the area, technical data 
and technical advice in assisting the Commission to interpret events as 
they occurred. Mr. Malley should advise Rankin that we suggestthat if 
such a re-enactment of the scene is considered desirable by the Commission, 
it should be carried out by Secret Service which has already gone through 
this exercise at least once. . .. y

Memorandum from Gauthier to Callahan’ dated 4/15/64 discusao^/flie ^ 

possibility of the President's Commission having aw 6-enactment at the^cene.of I 

the assassination and recommended that this matter be taken up with^Mr. Rankin, 
in order 16 advise him of the Bureau’s views relative to any such re-enactment.^vjy' - 

’ 0\J 

Malley discussed this matter with Mr. Rankin today, at which time fj ' v 
Mr. Rankin was advised that Die FBI had rendered every assistance possible VI 

by providing models of the area, technical data, and technical advice in assisting C 
the Commission to interpret events which occurred in Dallas. He was told that 
In view of this, plus the fact that a complete re-enactment had been previously /i 
made by the Secret Service, there did not appear to be a great deal that could \J • 
be done by having a re-enactment. He was also told that if a decision was madef \ 
to have the re-enactment, the FBI would prefer not to be involved in any such planV 

Mr. Rankin advised he had not been fully briefed concerning this matter. 

He said there had been some minor discussions concerning it and he would not 
favor any re-enactment which would cause a tremendous amount of publicity. He 
stated there were some technical problems and the Commission's only desire was 
to try and establish the approximate places where Die three shots hit the target 
so that the distances involved would not be out of line with the number of seconds 

in which it is believed the three shots were actually fired. . 

• - ■!- 

- Mr. Rankin stated that there would be considerable study on this matter 
before any actual requests of any kind would be made and he doubted at this time 
that there would be any re-enactment in Dallas.

Memorandum 4/17/64 Sullivan to Belmont set forth results of interview 
witn Secr^t^S.ervice Chief Rowley on 4/17/64 relative to the statement made by t 

Mr.* Rowley*^ to tiie effect that Secret Service had made the statement that Lee 
Harvey Oswald would have been under surveillance on November 22, 1963, if the 
Secret Service had been furnished information concerning Oswald. 

Mr. J. Lee Rankin was advised today by Malley that the Bureau had 
received information from several sources indicating that Secret Service has 
made comments that Oswald would have been under surveillance if they had • 
been advised of Oswald’s background. He was told that this matter was discussed i 

( with Secret Service Chief Rowley and Rowley had stated there was no information 
indicating the possibility of physical violence on the part of Oswald and that he 
would not, therefore, have been placed under surveillance. Rowley also stated . r 

I that had the Secret Service checked the building (Te.xas School Book Depository # 
Building) they would have taken no action concerning Oswald inasmuch as he jfj « . 

was employed in the building. . 

l/\ * * 

Mr. Rankin was told that we understood Special Agent in Charge 
Robert I.* Bouck of the Protective Research Section, Secret Service, was scheduled 
to appear before the Commission on 4/23/64 for testimony. Mr. Rankin verified 
that Bouck would appear. It was suggested that in view of Mr. Rowley’s state- 
ments it might be well for the Commission to officially inquire of Mr. Bouck the 
position Secret Service would have taken concerning this matter. 

Mr. Rankin was most appreciative of being advised of the comments 
made by Secret Service Chief Rowley on this matter and stated that the Commission 
would handle the matter in full on an official basis. / , , v . . .

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY . >77 

- - -J > 

My memorandum of 3-31-64 indicated that Mrs. JacquelinelCennedy had 

invited captioned individual to do a book concerning the six days surrounding the assassi* 
nation of the Fresident. This book will be published in 1968 or 1969. Referenced 

I * memorandum reported that Ed Guthman of the Department was most anxious for the 
Director to meet with Mr. Manchester concerning the book. Guthman promised that no\$ 
questions would be asked concerning the FBI investigation of the assassination. 

' / The Director indicated that he would not meet with Manchester in view of 

j the false allegations mentioned by Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach to the Warren 
; Commission indicating that information had been "leaked' by the FBI concerning our 
J investigation of the assassination. The Director indicat'd that Manchester should see me 

** v 

Guthman’s office called again on 4-21-64 wnt asked that I see Manchester 
at 3:30 p. m. on 4-22-64. Upon seeing Manchester, he advise*, me that he was primarily t 
interested in the activities of the Directo. immediately following the assassination of the. 
President. I told Manchester that the Director of course was the first one to advise the * 
Attorney General that hi? brother, the Fresident, had been shot and that the Director 
later advised that his brother was dead. Manchester told me that he knew this to be a fac 
and that he had visited .he Attorney General's home and the swi/..ming pool where the 
Attorney General had oeen standing at the lime the Dire lor had called him. He pointed c 
however that he desired to obtain this information from .e Director rather than from an 
assistant. i 

* \ /«*' ; f r o ~ unfcet. • 

Mane tester told me that he was having sohi<5 difficulty. in obtaining the 

( information that he wanted. He mentioned that most popple felt that nothing could be give 
to him until after the report «>i the Warren Commission had been issued. I told Manchest 
• I thought that for the most part this would certainly be true for the FBI inasmuch as we 
• were the' agency appointed by the President to bo .;hicfly responsible for the investigation 
• of both the assassination and the mu/dcr of Oswald. Manchester -told me that his questio 
i actually would not involve the FBI investigation of this c^3e. He stated that even if this 
were true he still felt that answers should be given to n.s questions inasmuch as his boo? 
would not be published for 4 or 5 years following the issuance of the Commission report.

later pose specific questions in order to round out the information. I told him this seeme 
to be the cart pulling the horse inasmuch as we would first want to know what he had in j 
mind and before we went to a great deal of work. I told him regardless of what he desire* 
he would still have to realize that no information concerning our investigation could be 

[released until after the issuance of the Commission report. 

■ • ■ 

* 

Manchester asked if the allegation were true that the FBI had known that 
Oswald was in Dallas, Texas, and at the Texas Book Depository at the time of the assas- 
| sination of the President. I answered in the affirmative, however, explained at great 
! length the fact that Oswald was not a violent -type person and there had been no reason to 
' notify Secret Service of his presence. I also explained to Manchester the cooperation WW 
had existed for many years between the FBI and Secret Service and of the fact that we cor 
stantly informed Secret Service of threats made against the President. 

Manchester told me that he was having considerable difficulty in getting an 
information from Secret Service. He slated that this organization has been criticized so 
severely and its personnel are so heartbroken over the tragedy that they are reluctant to 
talk about the assassination. »'• * 

In leaving, Manchester told me that he would be in town for approximately 
I three months living in a rented apartment. He stated that sometime during this three 
! months he would appreciate having a visit with the Director. I told him that the Director 
! schedule .was quite filled, however, we would be in touch with him if the Director had an 
opportunity to see him. I also told him that rather than wait for an appointment hemight 
desire lo’urile out his questions and give them to me. I reminded him, however, that it, 
was doubll j 1 that we could be of any assistance to him until after issuance of the CommiS 
sion report; * . • !;.* . • *; I ! 

. . r • v* The meeting with Manchester was on a cordial and pleasant basis, howeve 
j he fully understands our position. Butilcs reflect that our relations with him in the past ( 
ihave been most cordial. lie does appeals however, to.be somewhat of a dreamy non- . 
[specific type of individual. , y ( ^»vc J viS «• <

Hr. J. Ed Gar Hoover 
Director 

Federal Eurcau of Investigation 
Department of Justice 
Washington. D. C. 

Dear Mr. Itoover: 




• On Hovernber 25. 19^3# Mr. Dial D. Ryder made available for 
inspection by an egent of your Bureau a repair tag which Indicated 
that certain work, associated by Ryder with the mounting on a rifle 
and the sighting of a telescopic sight, was performed by the Irving 
Sports Shop, 221 East Irving Boulevard, Irving, Texas, for a man by 
the name of Oswald. That fact and others concerning this matter ere 
reported at pages 395*6 of the report of Special Agent Robert P. 

Cemberling, dated November 3^» 19°3» at Dallas, Texas. 

• • 

We note that other reports of your investigation concerning 
the above repair teg are set forth at pages 65-6 and 654-6 of the 
report of Special Agent Ctuberling dated December 23, 1963* an ^ 
page .96 of Agent Gemberling’s retort of March 10, 1964. We also note 
my letter to you dated February 21, 1964, your reply dated March 27# 
1964, and the memorandum of your Dallas office dated April 2, 1964, 
in response to the oral inquiry of Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler of our 
staff . , . . 

It also appears that personnel of the Irving Sports Shop 
have been contacted by the United States Secret Service (Secret 
Service Control Ho. 424) and the Dallas Police Department. (See 
pages 252-4 of that Deportment's report of its investigation of the 
assassination of the President.) Hr. Liebclcr has examined both 
Mr. Ryder and Hr. Greener, *.♦:<? owner of the Irving Sports Shop. 

A review of the nhc/c documents indicates a need for further 
investigation as suggested below: 

• . '* 

1. Agent Cemberling 'c ro?ort of November 30, 1964, (pages 
395-6) docs not indicate whore the interview there reported vas f 
conducted or the circumstances under which the vork tag was located. 
'In his deposition, Ryder stated that your Agent first came to his ,

hone on Monday, November 25, 17^3# -and that ^h°y subsequently vent 
to the shop to get the tog. (fr., 8-10.). : . ■' . .• 

L i < * * * • > *„* 

: * * Please advise us hov and vhy your Agent contacted Ryder in. 

the first instance. In that connection vc note that Ryder testified - • : 
that the Sports Shop vas closed ..on Monday. (Tr., 9*) v’f 

Ve vould like to knov whether or not your Acent vas actually * 
present when the tag vas found. If so, ve vould like to knov the 
circumstances under which the tac vas found. If not, ve vould like ’ - 

to knqv if your Agent asked Ryder vhen and under vhat circumstance* 
he first became aware of the tag's existence. 

In this connection, vc note that Officer F. M. Turner of the 
Dallas Police Department reported that on Sunday evening, November 24, 
1963# that Department had received a telephone call from one Ray John 
of Channel 8 news, presumably in Dallas, advising that the news office 
had received an anonymous phone call in which the caller had stated 
that "he (she) thought Oswald had had the rifle sighted-in on November 21 
I 963 , at a gun shop at 211 or 212 Irving Boulevard. Officer Turner 
reports that he checked and found the Irving Sports Shop at 221 East 
Irving Boulevard. The Officer spoke to Mr. Greener (time not indicated) 
vbo said that he and Ryder had discussed the matter but that neither 
could remember having done any work for Lee Oswald or on the assassina- 
tion weapon. Mr. Greener said he vould check his files for names and 
re-contact the Dallas Police Department. 

Hr. John should be interviewed in connection with the anonymous 
telephone call he received. Consideration should be given to the 
possibility that Ryder himself may have called Mr. John. Officer Turner 
might be able to supply additional infonmtion. The anonymous call may 
have cone from Mrs. Whitworth (see belov). 

In that connection, Mr. Greener said that a reporter for the 
(Dallas) Times Herald hed told him tliat he had spoken to Ryder before 
the FEI first came to the Sports Shop, i.e., before the story appeared 
in the newspapers on November 28*29, 19^3 • Ryder has denied to Greener 
that he talked to this reporter. 

. We think that a complete investigation into the question of 

hov, vhen and vherc the story concerning the Irving Sports Shop first 
came to the attention of the press would be very helpful in making a 
determination of the veracity of Messrs. Ryder and Greener. 

. ■ ■ - * • 

2. We vould appreciate further investigation into the question 
of vhen the vork tag vas made out. This phase of the investigation 
should be conducted on the assumption that the tag vas prepared prior 
to the assassination, although consideration should be given to ttie 
other possibility in connection vith the investigation ve have requested 
in paragraph 1 above.

We note that your reports indicate tliat Ryder said the vork 
vus done scicctiinc during the period Ho /ember 1-14, 1963* Mr. Ryder .> V 
.. . indicated the same to Mr. Liobclcr. , . . . ' . . . .V " 

.-.r- ■_ 

• - ■ v VC also note, however, that Ur. Creencr told Officer Turner' /*' • 

that it npj'cared that the rifle in question had probably been brought-’. . * 
in between November 4-8, ).9 <j 3* Creencr also told Turner that he vould - 
. check his cosh register receipts to see if he could determine vhen the 
rifle vas picked up and paid for. Ryder also noted that he had vritten 
the repair tag in pencil, but he usually used a pen. He said he * 
remembered picking up seme orders in Dallas one day in the past vhen he ’ .* 
did usS a pencil in his vork. It might also be possible to fix vithin 
• • certain limits the date the teg was. prepared by reference to its number, 

even though Ryder has indicated that they do not use the tags in any . • 

exact chronological order. 

r : - We vould appreciate additional investigation into the above ** - - 

points and alorg whatever other lines you deem appropriate in order to 
help fix the date on vhich the tag vas prepared. 




' i 



3* The significance of Officer Turner’s report that Greener 
had told him that the rifle had been brought in between November 4-8, 
1963# is clear vhen considered in connection with your report on 
Mrs. Edith Whitworth vho said she bad, on November 6 , 7 , or 8, 1963, 
directed Lee Harvey Oswald to a gun shop one and one-half blocks from. * * 

her used furniture store. (Page 65 of Gemberling’s report of 
December 23, 19^3 •) - * 

In connection with Mrs. Whitworth’s statements, vould you 
please advice (a) vhethcr she doc6 in fact have a grandchild vhich vas 
bom on or about October 20, 1963, and (b) whether or not in November, 
I963, there were any gun shops, other than the Irving Sports Shop, 
vithin one and one-half blocks of 14$ East Irving Boulevard, the 
former location of Mrs. Whitworth’s Furniture Mart.

4. Please advise whether or not your Bureau has ever received 
any indication that Lee Harvey Oswald ever owned any rifle other than 
the weapon identified by your Bureau ns "K-l". We vould also appreciate 
your advice as to the nature and extent of any investigation that you 
may have made concerning that possibility. 

*r'„ . „ * . . • . . 

. 5* In your letter to me dated March 27, 19^# you indicated 
’ : that Mr. Jerry A. Oswald, as veil as other persons having the last name 
• -* ’ of Oswald residing in Dallas and vicinity, were interviewed and all 



advised they had not taken a rifle to the Irving Sports' Shop to have a 
telescopic 6lght mounted. You noted that your investigation on this 
particular matter vas reported on pages 654-6 of Agent Cemberling’s 
report dated December 23, 1963. i -

REQUEST OF PRESIDENT’S COMMISSION "V » r j)Uv^ / 

Today I received a call from Mr. Milton Eisenberg, staff member 
of The Commission, inquiring concerning availability of SA James C. Cadigan y y 
for pretcslimony conference followed by testimony before the Commission. He ^ 
staled he would like to discuss SA Cadigaj^s testimony at 1:30 p. m. , today and k I 
have him testify at 11:00 a. m. , Thursday, 4/30/64. I told him SA Cadigan is • 
available and will appear at The Commission at both of the times indicated,. ^ - 

SA Cadigan* s testimony will relate to the handwriting identifications'^ * 
made In tills case by the FBI Laboratory. Included are handwritings appearing onj 
order to purchase the murder weapon, postal money order to make payment for'"'* 
the rifle and the application for the Post Office box to which the rifle was shipped ^ 
The writing on these documents has been identified as that of Oswald. p\ ^ 

’* »C\ «3 

Mr. Eisenberg also made reference to the numerous translations q 
tlie Laboratory has performed for The Commission and stated that he is now in J 
the process of preparing the foreign language exhibits for filing and retention an£ 
he wants to be absolutely certain that the translations are accurately matched upjj* 
to the foreign language exhibits to wliich they relate. He asked that we match ujo 
the exhibits and the translations (approximately 75 of them) currently In the 
possession of The Commission. I told him I would have someone familiar with Q 
this translation material get in touch with him to work out the arrangements. I {§ 
have referred this request to the Section Chief of the Cryptanalysis-Translation^- 
Section, Mr. C. F. Downing, and he lias designated SA Bertil W. Rolander to *§ 

. handle this matter. SA Rolander went to The Commission today to commence 
fulfillment of tills current request from Mr. Eisenberg. . • a

subjects ' ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT V * \ M/l 

. ' — : ' v-r ••••• ■ 3 ' . 

SAC Shanklin ot the Dallas Office called me at approximately 3:00 a.m. 
today relative to an article that was scheduled to come out in they .Dallas JMorning Kews^ 
tills morning by'Hugh-Apiesworlh. The article quoted Special Ag /nt*Hosty of the Dallas 
Office as stating to a Dallas police officer in discussion regarding Lee Harvey Oswald, 
"Y/e knew lie was capable of assassinating the President but we didn’t dream he’d do it*" 
The story is altiilwted to a source close to the Warren Commission. It mentions a 
memorandum given the Commission by Dallas Police Officer Jesse Curry which : * 
contains the alleged remarks by Agent Hosty. I told Slianklin to get in touch with * 

Editor Krueger of the ’’Dallas Morning News” and remind him that Shanklin had seen him 
two weeks ago and liad put the lie to the same story. I further told Shanklin not to make 
any comment about the story if it was printed but to let us know at FBI Headquarters of 
the results of his contact. 1_* . » ^ • .. V 

• •» ■ * - * *. ■. t, 1 . * • , 

- 5* 

SAC Slianklin advised me telephonically at approximately 11:00 a. m.^ today 

that he had contacted Krueger after a number of attempts and that Krueger had claimed 
that the story had already been printed prior to his having a chance to knock it out.** He 
apologized to Shanklin for not stopping the story, particularly since Shanklin had advised 
him two weeks ago that the story was false. • - , * 8 i ’ 

''Y * : ^ 7 * 9 V 

I ‘ •* Shanklin told nie that Felix MclCnighl, head.ob McKnight Newspapers^ tern 

called and was irritated over the fact licit the "Dallas Morning News" had engaged^ 
irresponsible journalism. McKnight stated he would like to put the lie to this slor^ ^ 
Shanklin referred him to FBI Headquarters, . , -- 5 r . . r - - g’ ^ 

I discussed this matter with Messrs. Belmont, Tolson and the Director. 
After receiving the Director’s approval, and In talking with McKnight who’.called FBI . 
Headquarters, I told McKnight that the above-mentioned statement which $ad been . 
attributed to SA Hosty w’as absolutely false and had no basis in fact whatsoever. 

McKnight slated he certainly appreciated the opportunity to set the recordjstraiglit and 
he \youl(l see to it that an article was prepared Immediately for the afternoon edition of h 
•newspaper,- He wanted to know if he could quote the Director as making this statement a 
I told him the Director was the spokesman for the FBI at all times, ,

Today, Mr. Norman Redlich of the Commission called Malley 
and requested that he accompany Messrs. Gauthier of the Exhibits Section 
and Shaneyfelt of the FBI Laboratory for a meeting to be held at 2:30 p. m. , ( 

today, for the purpose of discussing any further action that might be taken - 

in Dallas to resolve any remaining problems with regard to the motorcade 
and the assassination site. t • • _ . ’ J r

Mr. Redlich was advised that Mr. Shaneyfelt was not availably 
hi view of a court commitment, at which time, Redlich requested Gauthier g 
and Malley to attend the conference at 2:30 p. m. The conference lasted 5 
from 2:30 p. m. , until 5:10 p. m. , and was attended by a large number of £ 
Commission staff attorneys as well as Mr. J. Lee Rankin. . . K

it was most important to resolve the matter as closely as possible realizing 
that no precise point could be slated as the exact point where shots one, two • 
and three occurred. He stated that members of the Commission did not want 
any precise locations given but the Commission was extremely desirous of. * 
making sure by an on-lhc-sile check that the information set forth In the *; 
Commission’s report could be possible and not subject to questions concerning 
feasibility. ( , : . j* Ul . . D.C 

. . # ^ C" : • ft 1 - * • ♦*. _ # • — - ~ — 

As a result of much discussion as to whether it Would be 
necessary to utilize an automobile on the expressway where the shooting 
occurred and various other ramifications, Mr. Rankin indicated that he did 
feel that the matterhao to be resolved and there would be a certain degree - 
of publicity no matter how this mailer was handled. He asked specifically ‘ . 

j if the FBI would participate in carrying out the Commission’s request. 

| He was advised he had been previously told that the Bureau did not desire 
to participate in any re-enactment of the assassination and would prefer * . 
not to be involved; however, if there was any technical assistance that could 
be furnished without a re-enactment, the Bureau would certainly consider 
such a request In order to aid in any way possible. Q . 

Secret Service representative, Inspector Ton^Ketly, stated 
that Secret Service had been fully carrying out many requests from the 
Commission and would do whatever they were asked in this particular 
i matter. ■ ' . . * . . *- 

" - «•> . * # * > ■» 

Mr. Rankin advised the Commission members did not want 
any of the Commission staff members to be present and felt this should be 
handled by the Investigative agencies. It was pointed out to Mr. Rankin that 
based on the detailed discussion that had taken place, it was apparent that - . 
the Commission staff members were not In full agreement as to just what - 
they desired to be handled in Dallas or how it should be accomplished, and 
that in vi cw of this, it would certainly seem necessary to have staff members 
of the Commission who were familiar with what they were trying to accomplish, 
available to decide if they had achieved their purpose. Mr. Rankin stated 
that UiLs mailer would receive further consideration, and in the event he 
desired the Bureau to render any technical assistance, an appropriate . 
request would be made in writing for consideration by the Bureau.

'-••*• ' * It is noted that during the discussion today it was brought out 

that all living occupants of the car in which the President was riding, with 
the exception of the President's wile, have been interviewed and testimony 
taken by the Commission. This point obviously was of considerable content ion 
between members of the Commission staff inasmuch as they were constantly 
making remarks indicating that they were without benefit of possible additional 
information and felt that this work in Dallas should not proceed until this 
additional information was obtained or at least an attempt made to Interview 
Mrs. Kennedy. . ....... 

In the event a request is received from the Commission . . 

requesting the Bureau to participate, full consideration will be given and - *

I IB) MRS MARK E. MARTIN. AKA - SHIRLEY MARTIN - BOX 566, 

1 HOMINY. OKLAHOMA - INFORMATION CONCERNING — Mrs. Martin Is ‘ - 
currently engaged in a campaign of disseminating to FBI Offices, Federal 
agencies members of Congress and other prominent individuals, communi- 
cations apparently authored by her. These communications relate to the 
* Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and are critical of the 
FBt She reportedly is conducting her own investigation of the assassination 
which has included telephonic and personal interviews of principals con- . _ 
nected with this investigation. . .* 

Mrs. Martin has been previously interviewed and exhibited an 
insulting, argumentative and antagonistic attitude toward the FBI and its 
personnel She recently contacted one of our Southwest offices by telephone . 
and although Identifying herself, endeavored to elicit information pertinent 
to the assassination by using the pretext of belonging to a ladies garden - 
club. Two days later this office received a communication which in effect 
was a transcript of Mrs Martin's telephone conversation with our Agent. 

It would appear Mrs Martin is endeavoring to embarrass the 
FBI and may possibly telephone your office under pretext. You should be 
extremely circumspect in any dealings with her and be particularly alert 
to the possibility she may be recording your conversation. Any contacts 
with Mrs Martin or pertinent data develop'xl relating to her should be 
promptly furnished to the Bureau marked for the attention of the Crime 
Records Division Letters from Mrs Martin are not being acknowledged 
by the Bureau.

ARREST OF DAVID JOSEPH ST. JACQUES IN MEXICO . 

On December 17, 1963, a confidential source, who 
requested that his Identity not be divulged but who has 
furnished reliable information in the past and is in a position 
to be. very thoroughly informed with respect to activities of 
the Mexican police and security agencies in connection with 
‘the visit of the late President JOHN F* KENNEDY and Mrs* 

KENNEDY to Mexico in 1962, advised as follows: 

The only American citizen who was arrested in Mexico 
during the 1962 visit of the KENNEDY^ to Mexi co and who might 
be the individual referred to by DA V* D JOSEPH 

ST. JACQUES, who was arrested by Mexican authorities on 


W; M.s tfsrnm, 

^ * .'V.'J 


'T t t 


at 




v < 


June 29, 1962, when he endeavored to approach the automobile 
in which President KENNEDY was riding along Paseo de la . 
Reforma Avenue in the general area of the Mexican Social - • 
Security Institute* As the Presidential car approached him, 
ST. JACQUES stepped in front of the caravan, which did not , 
pause, causing him to step back. As he did so, he was 
knocked down by an escort officer and was taken into custody 
and detained at the Ministry of "Gobernacion" (Interior or 
Government, which also includes the Department of Immigration. 

Licenciado (Attorney) SANTIAGO IBANEZ LLAMAS, Chief 
of the Mexican Immigration Service Inspection Department, 
provided the following data with respect to ST. JACQUES: 


At the time of his arrest, ST. JACQUES had in his*'* 
possession three Bibles, a quantity of religious papers and 
documents, a diary, a notebook, a receipt in the amount of 
1QQ pesos ($8.00 U. S.) for a gas pellet gun, and miscellaneous 
papers. He affirmed that his purpose in trying to stop the 
motorcade was to speak to President KENNEDY concerning the 
fact that "seven hundred people are dying each day in the 
United States from hunger and unemployment or from noxious 
chemical elements which cause cancer with the chemical 
producing companies doing nothing about them.” He did not - 
have the gas projectile gun in his possession and claimed 
that he had arranged to purchase it because he had intended - 
traveling to Guatemala, which he understood was a "dangerous 
place." He alleged he had never taken delivery of the weapon. 


Included in the notebook of ST. JACQUES were some 
highly complimentary notations concerning Mrs. BETTY)J3IVINGS 
identified as the executive secretary of the American\ 
Benevolent Society in Mexico, which provides assistance to 
indigent Americans in Mexico City. Upon being interviewed 
by a confidential source abroad on June 29, 1962, Mrs. ^ 
BIVINGS related as follows: 

BACKGROUND DATA REGARDING ST. JAC QVS8 **• H 

. ST. JACQUES first appeared in Mexico about three 

and one-hali years earlier and secured a room in the home 
of a very prominent Mexican family with the surname of • 
AVILA DuCLOUD. She believed this family resided at Calle 


ft 


mm 








> 


c# 




✓ < 





U- 


' * ■> *' . . . 

Moutnnns Rocallosas 517, Colonla Lomas Virrcycs, Mexico,* * 

D. F. (D, F. refers to "Distrito Federal" - Foderal District 
or the Mexican Federal Capital). ST. JACQUES fell.deeply - 
.in love with a daughter of this family, MARIA PILAlw AVILOV 
x ()uCLOUD; however, the family objected to their marriage and 
reportedly sent the daughter to a school outside Mexico, | 
pos'sibly in Germany. ST. JACQUES felt that the daughter'-, 
was sent to Germany because the AVILA DuCLOUD family was.-, 
closely connected in some way with one General GROETMAN 
(phonetic) of Mexico, D. F., who was said to bo a retired 
German General who served with the German Army, possibly 
during World War 11* •« 

After the daughter was sent away , ST. JACQUES 
became very upset and commenced a search throughout Mexico 
in. an effort to ascertain her whereabouts. His efforts 
were unsuccessful, and ST. JACQUES went to Tucson, Arizona^ 
where he worked for a time in order to secure funds to 
continue his search. 

ST. JACQUES returned to Mexico, D. F. and continued 
his efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of MARIA\AVILA, but 
was unsuccessful. 

It was the opinion of Mrs. BIVINGS that ST. JACQ 
was an extreme "paranoid" and had a fixation involving the 
location of his girl friend. It was her opinion that 
ST. JACQUES was definitely in need of psychiatric treatment, 
'although she believed him to be harmless. She expressed the 
opinion that he would not intend any action against the 
President of the United States. She also believed ST. JACQUES 
bad undergone psychiatric treatment in the past. As an 
example of bis unusual behavior, Mrs. BIVINGS related that 
ST, JACQUES claimed he had entered into a pact with his girl 
frlcQd not to shave until she should reach the age of twenty- 
one, when she would inherit a large sum of money and be free 
to marry ST. JACQUES. Mrs. BIVINGS had noted that ST. JACQUES* 
mental condition had become progressively worse during the 
previous two years. . ^ 

Mrs. BIVINGS stated she was surprised to loarn tha 
ST. JACQUES was still in Mexico, D. F«, because he had told 




*

her he bad given up his apartment in Mexico, D. F., about v 
two weeks earlier, in order to go to the State of Guerrero';.,' 
to instruct illiterate Indians in a school operated by a 
religious order. . 

Mrs. DIVINGS indicated that she knew very little 
about the background of ST, JACQUES, other than that he had 
stated his mother resided in a small town in Texas. (It is 
to be noted that ST. JACQUES stated to interviewing officers 
of The Ministry of '’Gobernacion" that his father was dead * 
and that his mother resided In Queens, New York, New York, _ . 

and was sending him a weekly payment of $10.00 U. S.) 


On June 29, 1982, information was received to the 
effect that in 1949 one DAVID ST. JACQUES appeared at the 
New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
complained that he was being bothered by sonar devices. The_ 
conclusion was reached at that time that the complaining 
individual might be mentally unbalanced. §•-* - -4 

Licenciado SANTIAGO IBANEZ LLAMAS advised on July 3 # 
1962, that on that date DAVID JOSEPH ST. JACQUES had been • 
deported from Mexico by the Mexican Immigration Inspection ^6* 
Department, having been embarked at the Mexico City Central /t-A 
Airport on a direct airline flight to San Antonio, Texas. 

On July 9, 1962, the identification record for DAVID 
J. ST. JACQUES, who also had ujed the name of DAVID JOSEPH 
ST. JAMES, under FBI No . was received, with the 

following information listed thereon.

Communication apparently 


HOIK: " •’> 

This is the ninth letter to the Commission on Martin. • 
Above SAC letter alerted the field to Martin’s campaign 
of vilif ication of the Director and the FBI. Martin has : i / 
,beeh described as a "bright out" ard since the assassination * 
has been conducting her own investigation. * • 

This scurrilous coimnunica tlon taken together with this 
woman’? continuing attack on the Director suggests the 
possibility ot libel. It is pointed out however, that malice . 
must be shown as a fact to make a case of libel against a 
person critizihg a public official* .• 

Enclosed communication cr ItiTcs ' the Director for * ' *^'V ( 

denying tho alleged statements made by Lt. Jack Revill of * ' 

the Dallas FD that Agent James Hosty of our Dallas Office 
bad told Revill on 11/22/63 as Oswald was being brought in; Y' .'j* 
that "we knew he was capable of assassinating the President 
but we didn’t dream he would do it." She also alleges the - 
FBI, prior to the assassination, hsd knowledge Oswald had a 
rifle, know of his trip to Mexico and knew of his employment 
on the Presidential motorcade route. She further suggests that 
the assassintion was not an error in judgment but possibly by^. 
"design." ' ; / v ' .-v • v;

Mr. J. Lee Rankin of the President’s Commission called Malley aT 
7,: 15 p. m. 4/29/64 from New York. He advised Attpriiey General Waggone'b^arr 
of Texas had called him from Baltimore, Maryland, and furnished* information 
to him concerning one Paul Vr*0 troll of El Paso, Texas, who allegedly has a • - 
tape recording in his possession telling of a conspiracy'of the John Birch Society ,• 
to assassinate President Kennedy. This information supposedly was obtained 
by Carroll when he covered a meeting in Mexico sometime in the past. Attorney ^ 
General Carr told Rankin he had learned a Justice of the peace in Austin, Texas, . 

was holding a hearing (presumably a court of inquiry which can be called by a s 

justice of the peace in the State of Texas) on 4/30/64 and Carroll has been 
subpoenaed to appear before this hearing. \ c 

* I 

\ v 

Carr told Rankin there was some question as to whether Carroll 

was emotionally unstable and that he was concerned that the situation would get 5 j 
out of hand and considerable publicity would arise from the situation. r 'Carr told ^ . 
Rankin one Bob Looney, an attorney from Houston, Texas, who is running for 3 
Congress-atrlarge, had something to do with arranging for the hearing akAustin/* 
Mr. Rankin requested to be advised of any information the Bureau might ha vfij £ 
concerning this matter in order that he might advise Carr so that Carr mighfc , '\ 8 
take action to stop the hearing at Austin. ' \ “ fo/ 9 

v/r § 

1 The El Paso Office telephonically advised Paul. YottlerJCarroli had o 

appeared at the El Paso Office on 11/22/63 at which time he stated he had £? 
information of a conspiracy on the part of the John Birch Society and the American 
Nazi Party in late 1961 and early 1962 and that these two groups intended to take 
Control of the Republican Party and control of the United States by force if 
jicc.essary. On the occasion of this interview at the El Paso Office, Carroll 
jumped around the office, was almost impossible to control, and admitted 
• extensive psychiatric treatment in Dallas, Texas, as well as being under the 
care of a psychiatrist at El’^aso, Texas, at the time of the ‘interview, the 
doctor being Dr. Edmund P.V Jones of El Paso. At the time Carroll was 
unemployed and was allegedly writing a book. He. claimed he picked u;

Memo to Mr. Belmont from A. Posen 
re: Assassination of President 


( information while in Mexico and had attended a rally in a grove of trees |xit he 
could not furnish the location where this meeting occurred. He claimed members 


of the John Birch Society were present and a group of men wearing arm bands . 
was present He furnished as a reference for his membership in the John 
Birch Society one Dexter Mapel, III, and indicated Mapel resided in Dallas, Texas. 
On this occasion he made no reference to the assassination of President Kennedy. ' 

_ \ telephonically 

Carroll again contacted the El Paso Office/ at 5:30 a. m. on 4/29/64, 
s'taling he had received a subpoena from a justice of the peace in Austin, Texas, . 
and desired to talk with an Agent of the El Paso Office. He arrived at the 
El Paso Office with an attorney early in the morning but was incoheren t and it 
was difficult to obtain information concerning the nature of his visit fie did 
not have the subpoena in his possession and he was requested to obtain this 
subpoena and return to the El Paso Office. He did not do so. At 11:15 a. m. 
Carroll called the El Paso Office and in a frantic voice requested that the FBI 
stop all airplanes of Continental Airlines in order that he could get a plane 
immediately to Austin, Texas, to answer the subpoena of the justice of the peace. 

The above information was furnished to Mr. Rankin who was very 
appreciative of the information made available and stated there did not appear 
to be any reason for the Bureau to make any further attempts to interview 
Carroll. He was most appreciative of the information received and stated he 
| would contact Attorney General Carr of Texas. 

ACTION : 

Mr. Rankin was advised that full details concerning our contacts \ 
with Carroll will be obtained as well as the results of contacts with doctors \ 
who have treated Carroll and this information will be made available as soon \ 
v as possible.

Dallas by air tel 5/2/64 received anonymous -r : 
letter on 4/30/64 which vas postmarked at St. Thomas,/' 
Ontario, 4/27/64. This letter Infers tint one Jack 
Webber, not further identified, killed President : 

Kennedy and that Webber was killed by one Jack Frasher. • 

This appears to be a communication axitbored by an individual 
having mental difficulties and the writer endeavors to 
play up the fact that the Presidents name was and 

that "Jack" Ruby killed Oswald, therefore the other two • 
individuals must bo involved in some way. * •-* ' 

The above letter was checked through the . ,• -;'v> 
anonymous letter file and no ider.tif 1 action could be 
effected. However, in view of the allegations, it is 
felt we must make reasonable efforts to check this matter 
out and subsequently report to the Presidents Commission.

on Martin. SAC letter C4-23B dated 4/28/64 on Martin 
alerted the field to her continuing campaign of •; l 

vilification of the Director end the FBI. Martin - %■ 
has been described as a ’’bright nut** and since the ' 
assassination has been conducting her own investi- 
gation. 

Dallas by aivtel 5/»!/64 furnished the 
Bureau with two communications received, apparently 
• authored ard disseminated by I'artio. One of the 
communications has previously been furnished to the 
Commission by Bureau letter Q&/64. The communication 
which is now enclosed Indicates Martin has spoken with 
Mrs. Ruth Paine (Oswald and his wife resided with 
Paine at Irvi rg, Texas , prior to the assassination. 

She has been thoroughly interrogated by the Bureau and 
the Commission is fully aware of her background^ and . 
others and feels that Mrs. Paine has furnished 
conflicting stories which makes Martin question her 
testimony before tho Presidents Commission. . -

o£ Hr. end Hra. FLOYD O. DAVIS and others Who claim to have 
observed LEE HARVEY OSVIALD in the Spocts Dome Gun Range, there 
appear references to a large man with a blach heard. The 
President’s commission requested the results of investigation

On March is, 1964, FtOYD DAVIS of the Sports Dome 
Gun Range, 8000 West Davis, Dallas, Texas, advised that he had 
sighted on that day or the previous day the bearded man Who 
he had previously reported had in pone way been associated with 
'an individual believed by Davis to be OSWALD at the Sports Dome 
Gun Range. Mr. DAVIS stated that the bearded man was driving a 
1961 or 1962 red and vhlte Chevrolet Impale, bearing Texas 
License Number P’W 2958. 

m

registered to Southern Lead Rolling Company, 2823 North West- 
moreland, Dallas, Texas.

He did hie target practice In about the third position 
from the west end of the firing point* As he remembers, the 
position number was 7 or 8. The best he can remember Is that 
there wore a vhite male and White female firing together at the 
west end of tbs firing point. On the oast of his position were 
some 8 lx cr eight other individuals end possibly two or three 
others cn the gun r.*nge. He W33 not acquainted with anyone 
Who was at the range that day and cruld not recall well those 
who were there. He baliev€a ha was tha cnly lone individual and 
all others were in groups of various sixes. Upon viewing the 
photograph of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, Dallas Police Department Number 
54018, taken November 23, 1063, he advised OSWALD is unknown to 
him other thin through the nsvs media since the assassination of 

• President KENNEDY. He dcs? net recall seeing anyone at the 
Sports Dome. Gun R*.nce rc< anblicg LKE H\RVE Y OSWALD* He does 
not recall anyone shotting a rifle with a scope and believes most 
everyone el33 at the rang* ^looting .22 calibre rifles. He 
spoke cnly briefly with the prisons cn his left and right and 
this limited conversation wt 3 'i n regard to clearing firing points 
so every on*- could g»*> forward and tccenine their targets. 

Ha reload* his own s;«nurslti5n *Ahich he generally places 
in cardboard cartcn3. He dies cot believe he carried his ammu- 
nition loo?a in a cap cr piece of cloth vhen at the range at the 
above time. However, he do«a r.ot r-arerobsc specifically having 
his # ammunition in a box at the abov* tine. He fired about sixteen 
rounds total, cuT.y one cf wia fired in the .300 Super due to 

a malfunction of thu extractor.

President's Commission confirming a telephonic conversation 
between Mnllcy and Rankin on 4-2P-64 and to expedite field

BACKGROU ND: 

In try memorandum dated 4-30-434, I advised you Rankin 
called Malloy on the evening of 4-29-64 from New York and »j 

gated Attorney General Waggoner Carr of Texas had called him V 
•from Baltimore, Maryland. Carr reportedly stated one P aul V f I 
^'Carroll of El Paso, Texas,., allegedly had a tape recording I 

I tolling of a conspiracy of the John Birch Society to assassinate 
I President Kennedy. According to Rankin, Carr learned a .Justice 
of the peace in Austin, Texas, was to hold a hearing on 4-30-64 t 
at which Carroll had been subpoenaed to testify. 


< 

I | ■ This matter was immediately brought to the attention 

1 1 of the field, and we learned Carroll, an apparent "mental case," j 
Jihad already contacted our El Paso Office, Carroll in a very 
1 lipcohoreot and rambling manner sought FBI advice on the hearing 
at Austin, Texas. Carroll recontacted otr El Paso Office in a 
1 {highly nervous state, rambled incoherently requesting a statement 
I {from FBI to the effect he, Carroll, kuow nothing about the 
| {assassination. This of course was refused. .

I have been trying since Nov. 22 to write to you. But . ' 

I haven’t had the courage or nerve. I want to tell you what happened A. 
to me. Two weeks before J. FlCs murder; I dreamt about It. On the {/' 
day that It happened. I was at work at Nathon Liben, a wholesale R 
tobacco Co. One of our girls came running upstairs screaming "He’s 
dead." Everyone asked who she was talking about. "She said President 
Kennedy. " I said your crazy" But she insisted she had heard it on 
her radio. Finally when I got home and turned on the radio, I heard it 
myself that it really was true, I got scared I didn’t know what to think. 

I locked myself in the house, 1 didn’t cry because I was too shocked. The 
next day I started to think back about the dream. The day their son was 
being buried; I was watching it on TV. No one w ( as home but myself. As 
they walked up to the gravesitc I said out loud! "Three months from . 
now he will follow his son in death.! If I am correct about the day of 
his funeral, it was Aug. 22. three days before my birthday. What gets 
me, it’s as if someone pul those words in my mouth. Now the hard part. - 
This is the dream about JFK. About two weeks before it happed; I was 
sound asleep, Next thing I know, I see out local night paper The Knickerbock 
News in front of me. 1 am reading the headlines. "J. FK. Assasinated" His 
picture was exactly in the same sped. The left hand corner of the paper 
as it was in real life. All the details were the same. One exception, the 
printing In my dream used his initials in big, black, bold print. In real 
life it was ordinary print. I tried io pul it out of my mind as a bad dream 
or a night mare. Sir, If I had told you at the time that I dreamed of it; 
would you have believed me? I feel kind of guilty telling you now. Because 
I have no one else to turn to. Who would have believed me back then? 

RtC-.U ->• - 3055 

r Thank you tor letting me take-up your valuable time. 


Yours truly *

MISS MARGARET KINNER 
31 CENTRAL AVENUE 
ALBANY 10, NEW, YORK 

V , f 


V '/ .■ t / J / • / v. . - 

By letter dated 5-4-64 captioned individual wrote the Director and 
stated that she had been trying since November 22nd to get up the courage to write. 
She explained that two weeks prior to President Kennedy's murder she had a dream 
concerning it and in this dream she saw the headlines of the Albany, New York, 
Knickerbocker News proclaiming the death of the late President. She continued 
that she became so frightened that she locked herself in her home. 


The letter explained in some detail the circumstances of her dream 

( and advised that on the day the late President's infant son was buried, she was ‘ I 
watching television and said to herself, "Three months from now, he (meaning the 

. President) will follow his son in deathl" . 

* • * 

In conclusion. Miss Kinncr stated that she had tried to put all of 
this out of her mind but was unable to do so -and asked the Director if she had told 
him of her dream at the time it occurred, would he have believed her. She stated 
that she was feeling guilty about telling him now but is doing so because she has 
no one else to turn to. Bufilcs indicate reprint material on communism was sent 
to her on 11-5-63. At the time she was not Identifiable. 


OBSERVATION: 


It appears that Miss Kinner is suffering some sort of delusions 
and has a feeling of guilt concerning the death of the late President. In view of 
this she might be some sort of a mental case.

uiUECf: ASSASSINATION OF 

PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY, 
11/22/63, DALLAS, TEXAS * 


Mr, Arlen Specter, Staff Counsel, The President’s 
Commission, called Special Agent Robert A, Frazier on 
May 8, 1964, to request that he appear before the Commission 
on J!ay_13,_jL964, to testify concerning his examination of 
President Kennedy’s clothes, Governor Connally’s clothes * 
and the Presidential limousine. Mr. Specter stated he would 
call to advise the specific time at which SA Frazier should 
appear. 

% 

SA Frazier will testify concerning the holes in* 
President Kennedy’s clothes and Governor Connally’s clothes 
as to whether they were characteristic of bullet boles and 
as to whether they were entrance or exit holes. All examina-'/ 
tions have shown the holes in the back of the President’s 
coat and shirt wore typical of bullet entrance holes and thof 
hole in the front of the President's shirt in the collar area 
was characteristic of an exit hole of a projectile. A small 
elongated nick, present in the loft side of the knot of the 
.President’s tie may have been caused by the projectile which 
exited from the front of the President’s shirt but duo to the 
characteristics of the nick, no additional observations 
relative to it could be made. Although Governor Connally's 
clothes were cleaned and pressed before we received them, 
we found holes similar to bullet holes in his coat, shirt and 
trousers. The direction of passage of the bullet was not 
indicated by the clothing. ’»>

Memorandum to Mr. Conrad 
ASSASSINATION OF 
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY, 
11/22/63, DALLAS, TEXAS 
62-109060 


Tho Presidential limousine was examined for 
bullet fragments and bullet impact areas during tho early 
morning hours of November 23, 1963. It is expected that 
SA Frazier will testify to the characteristics of the 
Impact area on the inside surface of the windshield and 
on the inside surface of tho chrome strip above the 
windshield. These two impact areas may have been caused - 
by the two bullet fragments found in the front seat area 
of tho limousine by the Secret Service shortly after the 
limousine arrived by air from Dallas on November 23, 1963. 
Mr. Specter stated that he would also like testimony 
concerning the nature and location of recovery of the -* 
three load fragments found on the floor in the rear seat 
area of the limousine by our Laboratory examiners. . . 

Mr. Specter requested that SA Frazier bring to 
the Commission at the time he appears for testimony all 
of the evidence exhibits listed on the attached page.

Letter was received from Mr. Miller of the Department^ 
dated 4/23/64, which enclosed a letter from Miss Berta Phillips \ 
who claimed Mrs. Hyatt had important information concerning 
the death of President Kennedy. She claimed the assassination T* - 

was carried out by members of the "Highest Echelon of the ; 

Syndicate, called The Members of the House of Ax." 1 *. 

. ' * j ,*« . * # 

Mrs. Hyatt was interviewed and she stated she had 
learned that the Attorney General was interested in the "Cosa - 
Nostra" which she claimed was the lowest echelon of the syndicate. 

She claimed she was in touch with the highest echelon of the 
Syndicate through "demons and werewolves" who continually spoke 
to her in private." Mrs. Hyatt stated that as frequently done by 
werewolves she feels that such a demon could have entered the 
body of Lee Harvey Oswald and assassinated the President, lire. 
Marguerite Oswald has been in contact with Mrs. Hyatt and 
Division Five is aware of this situation. In view of Mrs. Hyatt's 
apparent mental condition, no further action is being taken and 
this information will appear in a subsequent report under the 
assassination caption being prepared by Dallas. Likewise, 

Secret Service and INS are being advised. Mrs. Hyatt is an alien. 
Copies to Secret Service and IKS by 0-141. Inserts furnished to

RE: MRS. FLORA FILKO HYATT 


Vi 


On. May 4, 1964, Miss Berta Phillips, 2517 Taft 
Street, Houston, Texas, advised she had written the above 
letter to the Attorney General at the request of Mrs* 

Flora Filko Hyatt. She stated she did not know whether 
or not Mrs. Hyatt was a "mental case," but Miss Phillips 
stated she "talked of people dressed in black." She 
stated Mrs. Hyatt had informed her that she "heard voices" 
and received much of her information in this manner. 

Miss Phillips stated she had at first thought Mrs. Hyatt 
was a spiritualist but has now decided she is not because 
Miss Phillips stated that she is a spiritualist and for 
this reason knows Mrs, Hyatt could not be one. 

Miss Fhillips stated that according to Mrs. 

Hyatt it had been "told to her ear" that the plot to 
assassinate President John F. Kennedy was made in Houston. 
She stated Mrs. Hyatt told her^fcftat the main individuals 
involved in this plot were Mr/T Sakowitz, head of Sakowitz .. 
Department Store, and Fred^ahas, a local news reporter. 

Miss Phillips stated that Mrs. Hyatt was divorced 
from her husband and she feels this divorce was brought 
about by Mrs. Hyatt *s peculiar actions. She stated in her 
conversations with Mrs. Hyatt she could get no actual sense 
out of her. Miss Phillips pointed out that she herself had 
no information whatever bearing on the assassination of 
President Kennedy and her action in directing a letter to 
the Attorney General v«as based solely on her desire to 
assist Mrs, Hyatt who was apparently reluctant to write 
this letter herself. Miss Phillips pointed out that she 
is 88 years old and due to her frail condition is unable 
to go about the town without assistance. 

On May 4, 1964. Mrs. Flora Filko Hyatt, 402 
Valentine, Apartment lOOo, was interviewed and furnished 
the following information: 1 y 

Mrs. Hyatt stated that she had requested Miss 
Berta Phillips, a friend or her*s, to write a letter to 
the Attorney General to bring to his attention certain ’ 'U: 
information which had come to her attention through de- 
mons who spoke into her ear. • . *.*

RE: MRS, FLORA FILKO HYATT • 

r, 1 r, - - ■ 

i " ' ■ ■ ^ 

She stated she has learned that the Attorney - ; . 

Ocneral was. Interested in the syndicate known a«-'Cos_a_. 

Nostra but she wanted to point out to the Attorney General 
that the Cosa Kostra v?as actually the lowest echelon of 
the syndicate. It dealt only with the physical aspects of 
the criminal situation in the United States and the world. 

She stated she was in touch with the highest echelon of 
the "syndicate" through demons and "werewolves" who were 
continually with her and spoke to her when she was in pri- 
vate, in her left ear, Mrs, Hyatt repeatedly referred to 
what she called her frequent contacts with the metaphysical • 
world, pointing out there are sometimes five or six "beings" * * 
speaking to her at once and imparting information concern- 
ing happenings outside the physical world, to which normal 
people are restricted, . ' 

Mrs, Hyatt stated that she felt she could be of . 
assistance to the Attorney General in his Investigations 
of Cosa Nostra and had in the past endeavored to contact 
him by telephone and through the FBI, 

Mrs, Hyatt advised that the higher eche/on of ' 

the "syndicate" was made up of members of the/Hpuse of Ax, 

She stated that in 1959 she had tried to brlira'this infor- 
mation to the attention of former President-'Herbert Hoover 
by letter. She stated since she has not received answers 
from letters of this type she feels that her mail lias been 
delayed or misdirected through activities of members of 
the House of Ax, ' 

She stated she had "explored" the syndicate and 
has determined that there are only two men who are willing 
and able to act against the syndicate and these are the 
President of the United States and the Attorney General, • 

Mrs, Hyatt explained that her efforts to relate this in- 
formation personally to the Attorney General were based 
on her belief there were very few people capable of under- 
standing the inetapliysical world, and she doubted that FBI 
Agents had had adequate training in this specialized field . 
to equip them to handle such information. > • 

In regard to the assassination of President 
Kennedy, Mrs. Hyatt states that as is frequently done by 
werewolves, she feels that such a demon could have entered' 
the body of Lee Harvey Oswald, assassinated the President, 


- 4 — 



• -• •

RE: MRS. FLORA FILKO Iff ATT 



and then returned the body to Oswald. She stated in several 
murder cases which received considerable newspaper publicity ; . 
in the Houston area she feels that the accused in these 
murders was not actually the one involved but his body was 
being used by werewolves. - 

She stated it is also possible that President 
Kennedy was not shot from the Texas Boole Depository Build- 
ing because werewolves could shoot him with a soundless 
gun from any position. 

• “ * * 

• 

Mrs. Hyatt advised that the Attorney General •’ 
could learn a lot from her through the study of the acti- 
vities of the members of the House of Ax. 

When questioned for specific statements concern- 
ing the circumstances of President Kennedy* s assassination* 

Mrs. Hyatt related that a voice told her on November 13* 

19^3* that two businessmen from Houston had gone to Dallas .j.- . 
on that date. She identified these men as Lewi^/Lechinger, • jv 
owner of a large Jewelry store in Houston* and a Mr. Sakowitz* 
one of the owners of the Sakowitz Department Store. Mrs. 

Hyatt stated she felt these two men were top leaders of the 
House of Ax and the trip to Dallas was undoubtedly related 
to. the plans for the assassination of President Kennedy. 

Mrs. Hyatt does not believe either of the above men were 
personally involved in the actual shooting but they had 
exerted their power through metaphysical forces acting on 
Lee Harvey Oswald. She stated infomviation of this nature 
is received by her not only from voices but also from 
"the stars." 

Mrs. Hyatt stated that she had had difficulty in 
bringing the above information to the attention of any 
responsible people because it seemed that no one wanted to 
listen to her story. Mrs. Hyatt stated she had been able 
to relate this information to Mrs. Oswald, the mother of 
Lee Harvey Oswald* and she understood that Mrs. Oswald had 
recorded her information on tape. Mrs. Hyatt stated she 
expected Mrs. Oswald would turn this tape over to the .-V 
Attorney General* 

* - •' ; 

Mrs. Hyatt advised that she was born and raised" f 
in Germany and came to the United States in 1927*

RE: MRS. FLORA FILKO HYATT ; vv> ; 

** 


The files of the Houston Office of the Federal , J • 

Bureau of investigation reflect that Flora Filko Hyatt was. ' 
interned on December 29, 19^1, by an Alien Enemy Hearing 
Board sitting in the Southern District of Texas. Tills 
board held that Hyatt entered the United States as a quota i 

immigrant at Houston, Texas, on December 22, 1927, under 
her maiden name. Flora Filko. Prior to her marriage end 
after her separation from her husband, she did household 
and domestic work for moderate compensation. She also re- 
ceived help from the Family Service Bureau in Houston : 

after separation from her husband. . j 


The Hearing Board set out that based on informa- j 

tion furnished, Mrs. Hyatt is almost fanatical in her [ 

loyalty to Hitler and to Germany and has so expressed her-. $ 

self on numerous occasions. They point out that the only - „ j 

excuse for her attitude might be that she is mentally un- | 

balanced on this subject. She has also been in frequent f 

touch with German propaganda agent 3, If not one herself. . • 

The board pointed out there wei»e found in her possession 

several photographs of Hitler and of German troops in 

action, and writings containing Nazi propaganda. * . 

% 

The records of the Immigration and Naturalization* ] 

Service, Houston, Texas, reflect that Mrs. Hyatt is an alien. • j

Ihc oth.'iaf >eeount of the Kenned) asvassma- 
lion o>n'Dl% <'f assertions about (o) the murJer 
weapon, f/»t the plj^c from whiwh the ahots were 
firej, anj the number of sholv fired, (r) the 
evape of the alleyeJ awavvin, and (<f) the murder 
of oth.er lippii. I will critically examine each 
aspcwl in turn, questioning the plausibility of the 
ofhvial jivouni anj poin:»ng"ou? the significant 
d«%crcpjnjes that apps'ar when earlier csplana* 
ti(*ns are miUheJ agims! the final account that 
I have just outlined. 

(a) Weapon 

There j% on file in Dallas an afTidivjt by the 
jv»!u< oflucr *h»» found a rifle on the auth fls>or 
of if^TMtD That jfhdiwl states Ihut the weapon 
was a 7.fA rmi. Mauser. Wade, on November 
22. stated that this w as the murder Weapon, 
and that Oswald's palm-pri/il was found on the 
wcafKm. Ihc next day rhe FBI released a report 
that Osw'jfJ had purchased a rifle in March 
under the alias ll»Jdel. But this riCe was a 
6 5 mm Baiun carbine After this Teport, Wade 
revered h»s position, the rifle be bad in his 
p*%>vc>NMn wa*. now an Italian carbine; il was no 
linger a Mauser. I: w js atw after this I~D1 report 
that V* jJc announced that he knew Oswald U>ed 
the ahas I liJdel N*cause he had found an 
identification Card in this name on Oswald’s 
pervert at the (inn oj his arreyt. But Wade did 
not explain wh) this ahix wjs not released the 
previous day when be had asserted lhal Oswald 
used the alias lee. The omission is mos< 
pj//lmg when one considers lhal the aliai Ixt 
was not immediate!) accessible to the Di/lai 
authorities fas was the alias H»ddrt), but had to 
be tmvosered b> a NCpjrate investigation. 

Aside from questions about the rifle itself and 
the alias under which it was purchased, what evi- 
dence is there that Oswald fired the rifle? The 
results of pjrjflm tests, administered lo Oswald 
to determine whcil»er or not he had recently fired 
a weapon, are on record in Dallas. While posi* 
live results in such tests can be produced by 
contact with substances other than gunpowder, 
negalise results definitely indicate that a person 
has not recently fired a weapon. 7T»c firing of w 
rifle leases gunpowder Iracex on the hands and 
face, if it is fired from the shoulder. And il 
would seem rather ridiculous for a person to 
have fired a rifle with telescopic sights from the 
hip. T be results of the paraffin tests were positive 
for Oswald’s right and left hands. The paraffin 
tests on Oswald’s face proved negative. More- 
over, contrary to WaJe's assertion on November 
22 about patm priniv. the FBI now states that 
’no palm-prints were found on the rifle.* 

(b) Scene of Ihe-Shooting ' 

'fhc crucial question here ii lo reconcile Ihe 
nature of ihc sxo'unds infixed on ibe President 
with Ihc unwavering contention that Ihe shots 
were fired front the Texas School Bool Deposi- 
tory building. uv follow the changing official 
reports as ihey attempt such a reconciliation. 

The three doctors who attended the President 
it Parkland Memorial Hospital immediately 


a r ier lb? abating *!^(cd to reporters a’ tl>c h^»>- 
pj'a! tl.a! one of Ihr b-!»ets h*d er, ter/d the 
President's tlirra: *ius' below the Adam's *pp r e 
T here is * i r ev. d.fl<rer*;e br.weer, an rnira n;c 
and an exit wound, and a!; three dc^fo's claimed 
fo have dealt daily with gun wounds. The bullet 
these doctors further stited, ranged downward 
withiiut exiting If the P/cs'd^n: had been sfcot 
as his car approached the T SKf) along Houston 
S;rcet, then Ihe nature of the thruat wound 
would be convuten; wirti the alirfation l>ia: the 
shots were fired from the sixth ft^or of that 
build. ng This was the first FBI interpretation. 
But all the witn^ves as well as the photographs 
of the shooting male clear that the car bad 
already made Ihc turn and wai f>e»d.rg toward* 
the overpass when the fret shot w*.* fred io 
-the President's throaL Photog^phi indcite bit 
car was seventy-five lo one hundred jards past 
tF»e building Ibe FBI next argued that the PrcaJ* 
dent had turned his head around (almo^ 
IKO degrees) and wan looking bad when t >/c firtl 
sho; was fired. Mr* Connally contrad.cicd Xbh 
by staling that she was ipeaking to the PrrvjdcOl 
immediately before he was shot — and she ww 
vlling directly in front of Mrs Kennedy. Tbn 
films also show President facing forward 
as the first ahot itrvrd him. How, then, can A 
butltf vhoi from behind enter Kennedy'* throat 
from the front? 

If the pJact of the ahooting Is fixed, if jibe 
posture of the President u fixed, then the Con- 
sistency of the final Acc-ourt can only be achieved 
by altering the initial Inlerprc'ation about the 
nature of the P/evident*i wour»d. Afier the three 
physicians were qurs'ioned by the FBI they 
issued a r.aitnxn! feveniog their earl’cr rlcw— 
on which l^) had b <m unanimous arvd def.nhe- 
The throat wound. f?/ey now uy, b an tzit 
wound. These doctors state th.at they are, how- 
ever, unable lo talk lo reporter* or to discuss the 
mancr further. 

But there remain other pieces of informatioo 
which ofheiats have no: reconciled with the latest 
state nxnl of the doctors.Thc firs" police bulletin, 
overheard by a reporter waiting for Ibe Presi- 
dent** motorcade ki a point farther along the 
route, w\is that *all firing appean lo have como 
from the overpass*— io front of the car. The 
first radio accounts of the assassination abated 
that a policeman rushed lo the overpass and wu 
seen chasing two person* on the overpay. 
Ominously, nothing further is ever mentioned 
about this report The front windshield of the 
President's car had a bullet bole in it IT* Secret 
Service prevented reporters at the hospital from 
coming close enough to determine Ibe direction 
of the build. The car was then flown bad lo 
Washington and remained in the custody of tbo 
Secret Service. Eight days later, the windshield 
of the car w as replaced. (Il is not Inown whether 
the shattered windshield was destroyed.) Finally, 
four reporters of the Dallas Morning AVhm, wit- 
nesses to the assassination, who were standing 
between the overpass and the TSBD, all daim 
that the shots were fired from In front of lb« 
President’* car. 

How many shotJ were there altogether 7 Ac- 
cording to tf>e official report three shots wero 
fired. But there appears to be five bu!!e<s. A frag- 
mented bullet w as found in (hs car (this h most 
likely the bullet which struck the President in ihe 
head and then exited); there was the bullet that 
‘struck* the President in the throat; there wu 
the bullet that struck Governor Connally; Ihcrt 
was a bullet found by the Sccrd Service on a 
stretcher, presumably the President's (although 
its origin is by no means definite); and there 
was a bullet found by a Dallas policeman in th©

What follow | is a brief rfvum* of the official 
gcconstruction of (he assassination. / 

Me Harvey Oswald, positioned at/the aixtlv 
flo or window of the Texas S^*hcx>! BtH>k De- 
pository budding (TSBD), fired thr^e rifle ahou 
at the President’s car as it was moving away 
from the building The Pr csidc/t was ttruck 
twice, once in the neck and on/c in the bead; 


Governor Connally of Texaa wax Uruck once. 
This occurred between 12.30 and 12.31. Oswald 


then walked down four fligys of stairs to the 
second floor of Ihc buildm/ where he took a 
coke from the coke-machirvT. A policeman who 
rushed into the building i/n mediately after Ihc 


not explain why this alias was nos released the 
previous day when he had asserted lhal Oswald 
used the alias I ec. The omission is mo* 
pu//!mg when one considers lhat the alias I-ec 
was not immediately acccvsib !e lo (he Dallas 
authorities (js was the abas IMdel), but had to 
be uncovered by a separate investigation. 

Aside from questions about the rifle itself anj 
the alas under which it was purchased, what evi- 
dence Is there lhat Oi*ofd fired the rifle? The 
results of paraflin test*, administered to Osw aid 
to determine whether or not he had recently fired 
a weapon, are on record in Dallas. White posi-

Supposedly tried to kill the arresting officer. The 
postman himself gave a d.ffcren! account of 
the arrest, stating that he prevented Oswald from 
firing the pistol at all by placing bis finger 
behind (he trigger before Oswald could puli jt. 
Confronted by the contradiction, Wade yet again 
changed his version to accord with that of the 
policeman Thus a! one mon»cnt Wade claims to 
have a marked bulicl in his possession; the next 
moment he denies he has such physical evidence. 
In the Tippit case, as in the Kennedy case, there 
is distortion, a reversal of interpretations and a 
mishandling of crucial physical evidence. 

* 

It might be argued in defence of the investi- 
gating agencies (hat in the atmosphere of ex- 
citement that followed Kennedy's assassination 
contradictions and imprecision* were due lo 
‘honest* confusion. Granted # (hat confusioo 
existed, why. then, should the officials be con - 
fin (until) certain of one thing. Oswald's guilt? 
Why is Oswald’s presumed guilt the constant in 
this vea of incomplete and conflicting evidence? 
Now, supposedly, the confusions have been clari- 
fied into a single consistent and convincing 
account. But if the case is convincing and con- 
sistent, why should witnesses refuse to comment 
(o the press after they have been questioned by 
the FBI? Why has Marina Oswald been held ia 
the custody of the Secret Service since the 
murder c: a r husband, more than two months 
ago? She i.ris had no direct and pcr>onaf con- 
tact with any of her friends, with her mothcr-in- 
law # or wiih any reporter Every communication 
10 her, and every statement by her, first passes 
through the hands of a public-relations ofT^er 
and a lawyer ippolnied ho her imerest' by Ibe 
Secret Service. Why. if the case is so convincing, 
has physical evidence, such as the windshield of 
the President's car, been unavailable for public 
examination? An alternative hypothesis to that 
of ‘honest’ confusion is the h> poihem that the 
initial confusion and the prevent secrecy are 
attributable to incongruities between the pre- 
sumption of Oswald's guilt and the inadequacy 
and intransigence of the evidence which would 
validate such a presumption.

According to the ofhcial version. Oswald*

would still have oot more than five /minutes to 
accomplish these same acts. V 

It does no! seem too plausible that the alleged

the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Our files contain Bfc 
article published in the "Daily Californian," BerlflLoy, . . 
California, on March 11, 1963, captioned "End the Speaker!

the Administration of the University of California denied the 
Department of History use of the University facilities to hold 
x>ne lecture of its regular colloquial scries. The Justifica- 
tion for the Administration's refusal was based upon an 
interpretation of Rule Five of the Kerr Directive, which in

correspondent for the "Ijondon Times," the article "The Riddle

connected with the Oswald and Ruby cases. The article attempted 
to show Oswald was not guilty of the assassination. Gold

On March 18, 1964, an individual who requested his 
identity not be divulged but who has furnished reliable 
information in the past, advised as folloi\*s: 

On K&rch 17, 1964, the source received a telephone 
call from JOr^GOLD, \jho identified himself as the New York 
correspondent for the London Times" newspaper, London, England. 
GOLD stated that he has been assigned to cover and report 
op the JACK RUBY trial at Dallas. GOLD expressed grave con- 
cern over a news story published March 6, 1964, in "The 
yfepectator", a highly respectable Lon don newspaper. GOLD 
/ continued, because of the prestige of the "Spectator", the 
' news story in question has appeared or will appear in 
leading news media throughout Europe. 

The news article ent.ijrled "The^Riddle of Dallas" 
carries as its author MORDEC Al/sRI ENBERCr "The author of /B /- 'f 
this article, a former Rhodes Scholar from Canada, is a 


* , u -V 


lecturer in sociology at ^Berkeley, # California. & 

According to GOLD, the essence of this news article 
is an attempt to show that LEE HARVEY OSWALD is not guilty 
of the assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY, and an 
attempt to show that Justice is. not being done in the 
OSWALD - RUBY case. GOLD continued that the article is an 
attempt to discredit the American system of Justice, the 
FBI, the Secret Service, the Dallas District Attorney and 
others connected with this case. GOLD is concerned that a 
very wrong impression of the actual events which happened 
in Dallas, Texas, November 22, 1963* is being conveyed in 
this article. The article, according to GOLD, is an attempt 
to raise grave doubts in the minds of readers. 

The source of this information advised that the 
news article also appeared in the March 10, 1964, issue of 
the "Christian Science Monitor." 

After GOLD 1 s call March 17, 1964, the source 
advised that he checked records of ••• university of Cali- 
fornia at Berkeley, Berkeley, Califoi’nia, and records of 
the Rhodes Scholarship, and determined that no person by

the name M)RDECAI BRIENBERG is now or ever has been affiliated 
with the University of California at Berkeley, and no record 
of such a person could be found who had been named a Rhodes 
Scholar. 

On March 18, 1964, the source received another 
telephone call from GOLD statins he had conducted his own 
inquiry regarding MORDECAI BRIENBERG and had learned that 
BRIENBERG is identical with MORTON BROWN, a former teaching 
assistant at University of California at Berkeley, and is 
presently a graduate student of University of California at 
Berkeley. 

GOLD was placed in telephonic contact with 
MORTON BROW! on March 18, 1964, at University of California 
at Berkeley, at which time BROWN (greatly astonished, accord- 
ing to GOLD; admitted writing the above mentioned article 
and sending it to friends at Oxford University, Cambridge, 
England. BROUN then told GOLD that his friends at Oxford 
University had placed the article in "The Spectator. V 

The source also advised that he had received a 
telephone call on March 18, 1964, from -ftews Week" magazine 
regarding this article, at which time the "News Week" 
representative stated his intention of publishing the article. 

The source furnished the following background

affairs for several years, having been Chairman of 
the Young Republicans at the University of Texas in 
Austin, Texas, and having attended several Young

opinion that there was a conspiracy between the John 
Birch Society and the American Nazi Party in 1961 and 
early 1962 to take over control of the Republican 
Party and then to take over the Government of the 
United States by force, if necessary. CARROLL stated 
that this "enterprise" was made up largely of retired 
Army personnel, but he could not furnish any facts to 
substantiate this allegation. 

CARROLL advised that lie. was born December 19, 
1933, at Waco, Texas, and graduate d from the University 
of Texas, at Austin, Texas.

A reviev of the extortion case on Turner at the ftireau

of the assassination of President Kennedy. There is no indication 
that Turner nado any threat against President Konnedy or had any

furnish full details in appropriate inserts for subsequent 
reporting and dissemination to Commission. They were not in * 
possession of pertient reports and communications in the 
extortion investigation. 

It is not felt we have the responsibility of furnishing 
this type Information to the Commission since it alleges no- 
knowledge of the assassination and Turner, like many Americans,* - 
expressed his personal feelings concern ing the assassination. 
While his remarks are calloused and intemperate there still does 
not appear to be any reason why this particular matter should be 
furnished to the Commission. 

For information, the extortion case was referred to 
us from the Department and Chief Justice Warren was advised of 
the threat. — — ■ " ■■■

A review of data to be included in a report in cap-

dancing near his tablerj 

/~~ I t was concluded that had use ^ P oor judgment 

In calling New Orleans detectives, in becoming involved in a 
discussion with police and management of the 809 Club and in making 
remarks which had been misconstrued as threats against the owner and 
a doorman at the club. It was also found that his personal conduct 
at the club was not in keeping with that required of a Special Agent 
and he was derelict in failing to report the matter to his SAC.^} 

ACTION: 


It would appear that K*? * 'vj5 meets the description of

in the absence of the SAC, Kyle Clark, ASAC ^Dal las,, was instructed 
to arrange for the immediate interview of to determine 

if he made the statement that Oswald was definitely an FBI informant

SUBJECT: ‘"ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT 


Ssafia^ 


4& 1 * 

_ A. 1^1 J 


^ /^n r ' ,WW' 

Walter' Jenkins, Special Assistant to the President, told me on 
4/29/64 that a friend of his had just returned from Dallas, Texas ^ In Dallas j 

Jenkins' friend had allegedly met with one of our Special Agents. This Agent had 
formerly been assigned to the New Orleans Office. The Agent told Jenkins' friend \ 
that he had been transferred from New Orleans as a result of getting into difficulty J 
with a woman in the French quarter. * 

The alleged Agent also reportedly told Jenkins' friend that he assisted 
in the investigation of the Oswald case and that Oswald, prior to his murder, was 
definitely an FBI informant. The VAgent" stated that FBI files in Washington would 
prove this fact. () 


[i " 


I told Jenkins that while I doubted very seriously that any of our Agents 
had furnished this fact to his ''friend, " that at the same time we, of course, would -i 
make a check and find out if the description .given this "Agent" fitted any of our people. 
I asked Jenkins if he would mind letting us interview his friend. He stated that the 5 
information had been furnished him in confidence and he preferred not to reveal the $ 
identity of this fellow. He stated he wanted to let us know, however, that he had matte 
it very clear to his friend that this was an old rumor that had arisen time and again, * 
and that the FBI had branded it as being completely false. Jenkins stated there was^ , • 
no question in his mind regarding the falsity of this matter. .4 

RECOMMENDATION: 

Despite the fact that this matter has been tied down as being false, 
it is considered desirable to review personnel files of Agents in Dallas to find out if 
any of the Agents have been transferred there from New Orleans for a type of 
disciplinary problem as described above. If there is such an Agent he should be 
interviewed regarding this matter. It is, therefore, suggested this memorandum be 
I forwarded to the Domestic Intelligence Division for appropriate action.

REl j ASSASSINATION OP PRESIDENT • *•;•<*? *r. V* •*, > 

JOIHf FITZGERALD KENNEDY X ' .’X^' 


This film has been reviewed at the Bureau and has not 
boon observed previously, however, it appears to be a file 
similar in nature to those photographed by numerous TV and Hews 
media personnel in the Dallas area following the assassination. 

The film reveals various scenes of the Texas Schoolbook . . y> t - 

Depository Building and activities of various police officers in f \\. 
the area. In view of the nature of the film, the possibility -’ 
exists the scene showing two Individuals running whose backs are 
toward the camera may bo police officers. If this Is the case, 
make appropriate contacts with logical police agencies and attempt 
to identify the so two men to bring this matter to a logical 
conclusion. Dallas is Instructed to retain appropriate inserts for 
inclusion in report and furnish the Bureau appropriate 
letterhead memorandum. . - 1 -

Now York in referenced alrtel Indicated appropriate s-; 
inserts are being furnished to Dallas. However, the Bureau 
Instructs the New York Office to submit a letterhead memorandum . 
revealing the source of this film and additional background as to 
how it was acquired. 

It is noted that upon reCoipt/letterhead memoranda 
revealing the above investigation, they will be furnished to the.,', 
President's Commission who will also be advised the film is ; 

available if do sired. All offices are Instructed to handle this 
matter expeditiously. ' - { • *

NOTE: * Tills matter pertains to Information furnished by Mrs. Einar 

W. Glaver and Mrs. Nell D. Crane of Los Angeles who 
observed on television the day following the assassination, a fils 
revealing two men running from the TSBDB Dallas, Texas. Investigation 
determined a film which may be the one referred to by Mrs. Giaver 
was located by New York which does depict two men running. However, 
they are not identifiable os their backs appear to the camera. 
Following the receipt of information from Los Angelos, Dallas and 
New York results will bo furnished to the President's Commission at 
which time it will bo indicated the film will bo available for \ 

review by the Commission if desired and will be retained by the 
Laboratory. It appears the individuals described may bo police 
officers who were in the Immediate area of the TSBDB following the 
assassination.

the three copies of this exhibit have been changed to D-129. 



The Bureau's attention is also called to the newspaper 
clipping captioned "Man Kills Minister# Ex-Wife at Church, Then 
Ends Own Life" mentioned on pages 1061 and 1068 of instant re- 
port which was designated Exhibit D-129# which has now been 
changed to D-131.

newspaper clippings originally marked D-131 ware not contained 
in the same letter and the foregoing change will result in the ‘ 
two clippings that were contained in the same letter being 
identified .by the same exhibit nun^er. 





Two copies of these exhibits are listed as enclosures

those copies being attached to the copies of the report that

In connection with inf onset ion set forth on page 37$ 
of instant report, it appears that, it would be virtually im- 
possible to identify the origin of the original transmission as 
furnished by Mr. L. B. CONNING without the use of specialized / 
equipment and monitoring the 227.075 megacycles Channel 
constantly. 


With respect to the telephone call to the San Antonio 
Office by one AMBROSE W. GOSCR, vfoich was taken by Security 
Clerk ERNEST G. LOCKER, JR., as reflected on page 447 of instant 
report, it should be noted that it was security Clerk LOCKER'S 
opinion that GCSCE was under the influence cf intoxicants. 
Subsequent to furnishing his opinions concerning the assassi- 
nation of President KENNED*/ , GCSCE rambled on, elaborating non- 
specific information about his family and his job.

With respect to information set forth on pages 746

mation is set forth* 


Under date of March 22, 1964, the Dallas Office was

similar information to that received by other offices and is

Under date of March 25* 1964, the Baltimore Office 
advised that it had received a four-cent postal card from 
Mrs. DOROTHY MENDENHALL containing similar information to 
that received by other offices. 

Under date of March 30 , 1964* the Portland and 
Tampa Offices advised that they had received a four-cent postal 
card from Mrs. DOROTHY MENDENHALL containing similar infor- 
mation to that received by other offices. 


On page 1070 of instant report it will be noted that 
certain obscene words are not reflected in the details. How- 
ever « such words are contained in the copies of Exhibit D-138 
enclosed with this report. In view of this* it was not felt 
that a separate enclosure reflecting the obscene language was 
necessary and essential to the proper reporting of this infor- 
mation. 




In connection with this report, it Should be botne^ 
in mind that the Dallas Office has a separate case in connection 
with the shooting of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, captioned "JACK Li RUBY, 
aha. i LEE HARVEY OSWALD, aha. (Deceased) - VICTIM! CR", Dallas 
file 44-1639, Bureau file 44-24016.

It is also pointed out that the Dallas Office has a 
separate case captioned "LEE HARVEY OSWALD, aha.v ZS - RUSSIA - 
CUBA", Dallas file 100-10461, Bureau file 305-82555. 

Numerous communications have been received bearing 
the ASSASSINATION caption (instant case) tAiicb contain infor- 
mation concerning OSWALD and/or his connection with the assassi- * 
nation, and such communications are being filed and reported in 
the case bearing the OSWALD caption. For the most part, , 
miscellaneous allegations bearing on the assassination are re- 
ported in instant case and all others in the LEE HARVEY OSWALD

r 

case. All information pertaining to items of evidence in 
connection with the assassination related to OSWALD are being 
reported under the LEE HARVEY OSWALD caption. 

r . The overlap in the period of this report with that 
of previous reports in this matter was occasioned by the fact 
that material with respect to certain allegations was withheld 
until such time as the complete resolving of the particular 
allegation could be included in one report. Also, much of the 
information contained in this report . originated with other 
offices. 

The contents of this report merely reflect those 
allegations thich, in the opinion of the Dallas Office, have 
been resolved completely. Numerous other allegations are under 
Investigation or the Dallas Office is awaiting receipt of 
appropriate FD-302's and inserts and, upon receipt of same, 
another report will be submitted in instant caption. 

Every effort has been made by the Dallas Office to 
review the numerous allegations for purposes of determining 
if they have been sufficiently resolved, recognizing this re- 
port will be disseminated to the President's Commission. How- 
ever, some of the complaints included are so nebulous it is 
difficult to determine that, if any, investigation can be con- 
ducted to resolve such allegations. In each instance every 
effort has been made to conduct thatever investigation was be- 
lieved logical. Zt is felt that any additional investigation 
into the potential for harming the President with respect to 
any of the individuals mentioned should lie within the juris- 
diction of the U. 8. Secret Service. However, it is felt that

On 5/13/64, SA Robert A. Frazier, Firearms Unit, FBI Laboratory, 
testified before the President’s Commission concerning the holes in President f 

Kennedy’s clothes and Governor Connnlly’s clothes and the examination made of 
the Presidential limousine. Mr. Arlen Specter, Staff Counsel, elicited the 
testimony which began at 11:30 a. m., and terminated without recess at 1:40 p. m. 

Chief Justice Earl Warren was present until approximately 12 noon. Mr. Allen 
W. Dulles, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency, was present for the 
entire session. j * 

w * 

SA Frazier testified that the holes in the back of the President’s coat 
and shirt were typical of bullet entrance holes and bore copper residues. 
(Copper-jacketed bullets were used inthc assassination.) He also testified that 
the hole in the front of the President’s shirt, in the collar area, was character- 
istic of an exit hole of a projectile but no copper was present around this hole. 

A small elongated nick, present in the left side of the knot of the President’s tie 
was described by SA Frazier. This nick may have been caused by the projectile 
' which exited from the front of the President’s shirt. SA Frazier testified that 
Governor Connally’s clothes had been cleaned and pressed before receipt in the 
Laboratory and the only determination of value from the examination of the holes 
in his coat, shirt and pants was that they could have been caused by one or more 
bullets. The direction of passage could not be determined. 


In connection with his testimony concerning the Presidential limousine, 
SA Frazier described the impact area on the inside surface of the windshield and 
the impact area on the inside surface of the chrome strip above the windshield 
and testified that they may have been caused by impact of the two bullet fragments 

found in the front seat area of the limousine. SA Frazier described the three lead

particles found by the laboratory examiners in the rear seat area. In this 
connection, Mr. Specter inquired as to the results of the spectrographic 
comparisons of the assassination bullets with the lead fragments from the car, 
the two lead fragments from President Kennedy’s head, the lead fragment from 
Governor Connally’s arm and the lead scraping from the inside of the windshield. 
Frazier stated that the spectrographic examinations had been made by other 
examiners but that the Laboratory report described these exhibits as being similar 
in metallic composition. SA Frazier advised the Commission that detailed testimony 
concerning these exhibits would have to come from SA John F. Gallagher, 
Spectrography Unit, FBI Laboratory. 

Mr. Specter asked SA Frazier to produce the President’s bandages and 
belt but did not ask any specific questions concerning them. 

• 

The exhibits used to illustrate SA Frazier’s testimony are listed on the 
attached sheet. These exhibits have all previously been made a matter of record 
and are now in the possession of the Commission, with the exception of the 
windshield which is in the possession of the Secret Service.

Attached is a copy of the transcript of tay testimony • 
before the Presidents Commission on the^ssagsjlna.t.ioix.Qf^^.. 
President .Kennedy. I have marked in red pencil the changes, 
“primarily typos and misspellings, which we will call to the 
attention of Mr. Stern in accordance v/ith his request. 

On Page 6163 aid 6164 the Commission suggested we 
change our Manual of Instructions to replace the word '’and" 
to "or" in two places. The change is being made and will be 
sent out to the field early next week. 

On Page 619S Mr. Dulles mentioned the bool: "*Jbo Killed 
' Kennedy" by Thomas G. Buchanan. He said the Commission would 
ma]ce a copy available to \ir: and he would like our comments. The~-«. 
Commission has not yet given the book to us and we will follow 
up on this on Monday, Mr./ M. 

Starting on Page 8303 Chairman Harren referred -to an 
article in the "National inquirer" by John Konshaw. This article 
was sent to us by the Commission for comment. Tic interviewed 
' Chief Curry of the Dallam Police Department and he branded por- 
tions of the story as false and we have sent a letter to the 
{Commission to that effect. T7e are analyzing the remainder of 
the article and will furnish our comments to the Commission. 

Starting on Pago 6143 there is a discussion of thc‘ 
Bureau file on Oswald up to the date of the assassination. The 
Commission decided that the Commission staff* members would 
determine how many of the documents in this file the Commission 
already has and then wouTwd decide which, if any, of the remaining 
serials are necessary for the Commission, Mr, Stern of the 
Commission staff has advised he is working on this and will 
consult with us Monday, Hay 11.

NOTE: 

This is the eleventh letter to the Commission 
on Martin. Above SAC letter alerted the field to her 
campaign of vilification of the Director and the FBI. 

Martin has been described as a "bright nut" and since 
the assassination has been conducting her own investigation. 

The current communication sets out excerpts 
taken from various newspapers and periodicals in an j 

apparent effort to show that the investigation of the j 

assassination will be a "whitewash."

World Press 


Recently wo were askedi "Are you saying you won't accept a verdict 
from, the Warren Commission no matter what it la?" 

On December 16, 1963* Chief Justice Earl "Warren told questioners 
that the commission does not expect to call for the physical 
evidence in the case, for instance, the Italian-made carbine with 
which the shots were fired, or the recovered bullets ** 1 (New 
'Orleans Times Picayune, 12/l?/63) 

On February 23, 1964, "the commission, headed by Chief Justioe 
Earl Warren. ••said that two months of investigation had 'not 
caused the commission to doubt the reasonableness of the action 
by the authorities in charging Oswald. 1 " (NT Times, 2/26/6k) 

"That evidence ranging from FINGERPRINTS (nonexistent!) *to ballis- 
tics tests is as conclusive as any confession, and there is NO 
LINGERING DOUBT About what the commission's main findings will 
be." l.e. Oswald's guilt. (TIKE Magaeine, 3/14/64) 

"We hope to COMPLETE our study and publish our report early this 
coming summer." (Letter from Commissioner Gerald Ford, 2/26/6k) 
Mr. Ford thus set in February a limit to an investigation the 
termination of which should NOT have been predetermined. 

Also to be considered is the remark by Chief Justice Earl Warren 
that certain testimony recorded in regard to the case would not 
be released "in your lifetime." Hr. Warren concluded this state- 
ment by adding 1 "And I say that seriously." 

In light of this (and more) how can the "American people and the 
world" be expected to "accept a verdict from the Warren Commission 
no matter what it la?" 

Whatever the verdict, will Hietory reoeive it as oonsistent ( con- 
stitutional, rational and scientific?

, The Department forwarded to us a ten-page dissertation 
in the Russian language which was translated at the Bureau. 
Briefly, Volsky claims that a number of people knew about a 
"conspiracy” to assassinate the President. He claims that the 
ones responsible are members of a Zionist Organization and. 
feel Kennedy went against the Jews after his election to office. 
Volsky deals in some fanciful conclusions based on his own 
personal anti-Semitic feelings. It is felt in view of 
allegation Volsky should be interviewed and this matter resolved, 
reported and disseminated to Commission as in similar cases.^ % ,•

Please accept for reading the enclosed article .under the 

heading of "The links of a chain of conspiracies by Z ion- Judal sns'' 

It should interest you in the part (pages 22-32) describing 

a murder of your late brother John F. Kennedi. It is written by 

* 

myself and signed by my pseudonym ABER. 

From my viewpoint it is the most probable version of what 
had occurred in Dallas in November of 1963. As to my friends 
who read it they consider it as a truthful story deserving to 
be published. 

I apologize that it has not been translated into English 
as it should be, but I am an old man of eighty-two years of age 
unable to do it now* X think that somebody in your office 
speaking Russian (not a Jew, certainly) could do it easily** 

Hoping that my letter will meet your favorable attention, 

I am,

Very sincerely yours

SUMMARY FROM RUSSIAN 


l 


■ J£ : 

-.If. 


Pages 22 - 32 of an article by Andrew I. Volsky, signed "ABER," 


The writer alleges that a number of people knew 
about a conspiracy against President Kennedy's life; a 
woman Journalist (FNU) Coldwcll warned about it; finally 
the reports reached the "all-knowing FBI" which hinted 
about the plot to certain official agencies, but th of only 
one who knew nothing about it was President Kennedy 'himself. 
No one warned him of the danger. 

• 

After the assassination, the general public, 
stunned by the event, was at a loss to understand wh7 and 
who would want to kill the President of the U. S. However, 
"people with mature political minds and knowledge of 
historic facts" knew that at the bottom of all this was 
the Zionist Sanhedrin (Supreme Council), which resolved to 
liquidate President Kennedy because he stood in the way of 
its plans for the world domination. 

Although President Kennedy associated with the 
Jews, much to the chagrin of his father and brothers, 
and although he was elected with the help of the Jews, 
after he became the President of the U. S. he started to 
act independently and went against the Jewish policy of 
cold war (which they hope to turn into the "hot" one). 

• 

Furthermore, President Kennedy never allowed his 
wife Jacqueline (a French Jewess, according to the writer) 
to interfere with affairs of State; he had never consulted 
Bernard Baruch, that power behind-the-scenes. When Zionists 
learned of his attempts to get free of the Jewish influence, 
his doom was sealed. 

Lee Harvey Oswald was chosen as the assassin by 
Zionists because of his procommunist tendencies and his 
reputation as a marksman. Moreover, Oswald disliked 
President Kennedy because of his irreconcilable attitude 
toward Cuba, with which Oswald sympathized.

The writer becomes somewhat confused alleging 
that Oswald went to Russia sometime after September 27* 1963, 
Where arrange men is ferthe a ssfpHfi nation were made, because it*. 

Was risky to discuss sueb^things in the U. S. The writer v ' - v' 
suspects that Isaac Etoj/Levine went to kloscow and spent a „ ^ 
month there as an emissary of Zionists, to arrange terms 
withosw.ro. ^ t j .. <y |,..l ' ’ 

Oswald's employers tested his skill by ordering 
him to 6hoot General Walker and although Oswald failed 
in the attempt, his bullet passed less than an inch over 
the General's head and Zionists were satisfied. 

Oswald was then killed by Jack Ruby to prevent 
his talking. The subsequent investigation seems to have been 
carried out for the purpose of covering up the tracks rather 
than for discovering the truth. The investigation got, for 
some reason, into the hands of a commission headed by a 
Jew, Earl Warren, rather than entrusted to experienced lawyers 
appointed by Robert Kennedy, brother of the late President. 

4 

By promising to follow President Kennedy's policy 
of peace and improved relations with the Soviet Union, 

President Johnson put himself even in greater' danger than 
President Kennedy did, according to Journalist Coldwell. 

In conclusion, the writer expresses a "firm hope" 
that the truth will come out in the end, no matter how 
Zionists try to conceal it.

The envelope is addressed to the Justice Department 
of the United States of America, Washington, (D. C.). It bears 
the postmark of Slade (N. Hannover, Prussia, Germany), dated 
April ... (illegible), 1964. 


The return address reads^ 



Friedrich Rudolf Buske

Gefluegelhof Birkcnhcim 
(West Germany) 


Stade, April 8, 1964 


To the Justice Department 
of the United States of America 
Washington, (D. C.) 

* 

Gentlemen: 

I take the liberty of urging you to place yourselves •* 
in contact with the Of lice for the Protection of the Ijl, 

Constitution of the German Federal Government, Office of the I* 
Foreign Ministry in Hannover. 

On March 17, 1964, I submitted to the above office 
certain data and information which should prove very 
interesting also to you. They might have a direct bearing 
on the causes of the assassination of your President Kennedy. 

The indications I furnished are of great significance 
inasmuch as I believe to have dependable information to the 
effect that those "guided actions" will become particularly 
important in the near future and will undoubtedly occur.

The Department as a usual practice forwarded - 


to the Bureau a number of communications in foreign 
languages for translation. After translation these 
matters are normally returned to the Department for its 
information. The letter from Buske was not returned . ^ 
inasmuch as the letter contained information to the ' t . 
effect that Busko had information which "might have a %T- 

direct bearing on the causes of the assassination.** . • 

In view of Buske *s allegation it is felt we have the • 
responsibility of running this matter out and have the 
results reported by Dallas for dissemination to the 
Commission.

television the day following the assassination a film revealing ■»* 
two men allegedly running near to and possibly away from the Texas 
School Book Depository Building. In an endeavor to locate this 
film it was established the film originated in New York. One film 
was located by the New York Office depicting two men running in the 
vicinity of the Texas School Book Depository Building who appeared 
to bo police officers as this film showed activities of various t ■ y C 
police officials around this building following the assassination. 

When this particular film was observed by Mrs. Giaver and Mrs. Crane, 
they stated it was not the film observed. In view of the voluminous 
films taken during and subsequent to the assassination by various 
news and TV media, it appears this particular matter has been 
logically pursued and no useful benefit could be derived from further

buys and sells and trades magazines. A cursory view reflected 
that it had a large number of nude magazines for sale and appeared

LEE HARVEY OSWALD 

t 



The President's commission, by letter dated May 12, 

1964, requested that Mr. H. R. BRIGHT, Mr. EDGAR CRISSEY and 
Mr. NELSON BUNKER HUNT, %ho had been identified as contributors 
to the fund used in payment for the advertisement Which appeared 
in the "Dallas Morning News" on November 22, 1963, be interviewed.' 
This was a full-page advertisement signed by the American Fact- 
Finding Committee, BERNARD WEISSMAN, Chairman. 


I 


J 


On May 15, 1964, Mr. HARVEY ROBERT BRIGHT, %dio is also 
known as "BUM" BRIGHT , an independent oil operator of the firm of 
Bright and Schiff, Mercantile Continental Building, Dallas, Texas, 
was interviewed, commencing at 10t48 A.M., and was advised that ha 
did not have to make any statement and that any statement he did 
make could be used against him in a court of law. He was advised 
he had a right to consult with a lawyer before making any state- 
ment • 

BRIGHT stated he desired to be interviewed in the presence 
of his attorney, ROBERT PAYNE, vrtio sat in on the interview. 

Mr. BRIGHT stated he did not know JACK RUBY or LEE HARVEY 
OSWALD and had had no contact or dealings with them at any time. 

BRIGHT stated that sometime prior to the time the full- 
page advertisement, vfoiCh was signed by the American Fact-Finding 
Committee, appeared in the "Dallas Morning News" on November 22, 
1963, he had been solicited to contribute to such an advertisement. 
BRIGHT declined to give the names of the persons %ho had contacted 
him, terming them "A" and "B". He said that "A" first called him 
and asked him if he would make a contribution to such an advertise- 
ment and BRIGHT agreed. He said that later, "A" and "B" came to 


I 


• 



bis office in the Kercantile Continental Building in Dallas, * • 
which was two or three days or perhaps a week prior to the time 
the "Dallas Horning Hews" ran this advertisement. "B, " ac- - V - . 

cording to BRIGHT, stated he did not have the money to put up 
for the advertisement and llr. BRIGHT stated he put up "B'c" 
money for him nnd considered it in the nature of a loan. Ho 
said he currently carries it on his books and it is believed 
that "B" owes him $300.00 or $400.00 now, but did not remember 
whether all of this was for the advertisement. BRIGHT stated 
he wro^e out a check for "B's" contribution for the advertise- 
ment, as well as for his contribution, and that "B" signed 
notes for the amount owed BRIGHT. BRIGHT stated he had not 
collected any money from "B" and that the money contributed 
for the advertisement was his own and was not supplied by any 
other persons. He advised he did not solicit any funds from 
others in connection with this matter. Ke remarked that he 
might have "bankrolled" "B" for this contribution as he did 
not know whether "B" was going to pay him back or not. On the 
other hand, he said "B" might malie the full contribution and 
then he, BRIGHT, would not be a contributor. Re said he would 
have to contact "B" to determine if "B" would pay the entire 
amount of the contribution. BRIGHT declined to give the names 
of the people who had contacted him as well as the amount of 
his contribution nnd that of "B." BRIGHT stated that the 
advertisement which appeared in the "Dallas Horning Hews" .on 
November 22, 1SC3, had been read to him over the telephone, 
but declined to give the name of the individual who read it to him. 

The interview was terminated at 11:05 A.U. 

On Uay 15, 1954, Ur. EDGAR R. CRISSEY, an insurance wan 
associated with E. F. White & Associates, 1115 Fidelity Union 
Building, Dallas, Texas, who resides at 3320 Villanova Street, 
Dallas, Texas, v/as advised that he did not have to make any state- 
ment and that any statement he did make could be used against him 
in a court of law. He was advised that he could consult with a 
lawyer prior to making any statement. 

CRISSEY stated he was not acquainted with LEE HARVEY 
OSWALD or JACK RUBY and never had had any contact with either of 


2 



♦ • T / T 

them. CRISSEY collected contributions* he related* for the 
insertion c£ an advertisement in the "Pallas Morning News," 
on November 22, 1963, vhich advertisement was edged in blech* 
and signed by tihe American Fact-Finding Committee, BERNARD 
WEISSMAN , Chairman. CRISSEY stated he had never hr.own WEISSMAN, 
but solicited contributions at the request of a friend, JOE 
GRINNAN. CRISSEY stated he contributed §15.00 in cash for this 
advertisement In the "Dallas Morning News" and had collected, in 
all, approximately §135.00 from two or three other people. Be 
declined to give the names of these individuals, stating the 
money was collected as a matter of confidence and he promised 
then at the time that their names would not be divulged. Be 
stated that these people Who had contributed to him, he was 
sure, did not know OSWALD or RUBY. The approximately §135.00 
collected by him was turned over to JOE GRINNAN for expense 
concerning the insertion of ,the advertisement. 

JOE GRINNAN contacted CRISSEY about cue weak prior 
to November 22, 1963, stating he desired to place the advertise- 
ment in the "Dallas Morning News," and requested him to solicit 
funds for an advertisement to be placed in the "Dallas Morning. 
News." CRISSEY understood that the Legal Department, of the 
"Dallas Morning News," had reviewed the advertisement prior to* 

. its beLng run in the November 22, 1963, issues of the "Dallas 
Morning News." CRISSEY stated that they had very little time 
•in tdiitih to obtain contributions and he understood that BUNKER 
HUNT had contributed and a person known as "BUM" BRIGHT, with 
offices 1 a the Mercantile Continental Building, was also • 
contributor. 

CRISSEY stated the last thing they wanted was for 
something to happen to President KENNEDY, terming the insertion 
of the advertisement as being ill-timed. Be said that no 
organization sponsored the advertisement that he knew of, al- 
though it was signed by BERNARD WEISSMAN, tftiom ha did not know. 

CRISSEY stated the article was written by a man %6iosa 
name he did know at the time, but Whose name he had forgotten. 
CRISSEY stated he saw a proof copy of the advertisement prior 
to its being run in the newspaper. Be believed the newspaper 


3 



advertisement cost approximately $1,500.00, and stated be did 
not wisn to reveal the names of persons who contributed. 


On Kay 15, 19S4, Mr. KELSON BUNKER HUNT, 4508 Lakesido 
Drive, Dallas, Texas, with offices on the 7th Floor, Mercantile - 
Securities Building, Dallas, Texas, an independent oil operator, 
at the outset of the Interview requested that his secretary call 
his attorney prior to being interviewed. He was, therefore, 
interviewed in the presence of his attorney, IVAN IRVIN. 

i 

HUNT readily admitted having contributed cash to JOE 
GRINNAN for the purpose of placing an advertisement in the "Dallas 
Morning News." This advertisement appeared on November 22, 1963, 
and v/as signed by the American Fact-Finding Committee. HUNT 
termed it an article which asked some embarrassing questions of 
President KENNEDY. He said he could not recall the amount he 
contributed, but believed it to be between $200.00 and $300.00. 

He gave the contribution to JOE GRINNAN in cash, merely reaching j 
in his pocket and pulling forth the contribution. He demonstrated 
this by reaching in his pocket and exposing a roll of bills while ' 
being interviewed. He said JOE GRINNAN contacted him several days 
before the "Dallas Morning News" ran the advertisement and told 
him by telephone that the "Dallas Morning News" would publish 
this advertisement. He later came by the HUNT office and re- 
ceived the money, Mr. HUNT related. 

I 

HUNT was unable to state whether he had read the | 

article prior to publication, but stated that GRINNAN might have i 
read some of it over the telephone or might have told him about 
It. He stated the article was a criticism of President KENNEDY 
in a dignified way. He stated the money contributed by him was 
his own money and he did not solicit or obtain contributions from 
any other person. 

HUNT stated he did not know LEE HARVEY OSWALD or JACK 
RUBY and stated he had never had any contact with them. He did 
not know the names of others who had contributed toward the cost 
of the advertisement and did not know BERNARD WEISSKAN, whose 
name appeared on the advertisement. He stated that he understood, 
from reading the papers, that WEISSMAN came from New York.

HUNT did not Xnow of any organization Who had sponsored 
the advertisement and did not Xnow anything concerning the 
American Fact "Finding Committee. He did not Xnow Who prepared 
this advertisement for publication and remarked that the timing 
of the advertisement was not too good.

You previously have been advised that the book **Who Killed 
Kennedy?" written by Thomks G. Buchanan, has created considerable attention^ 
in Europe. You may be interested in the following information which was ^ 
volunteered to Agent Papick on 5/19/64 by John McCone, Director, CIA: ; ' 

McCone advised that about thre4 weeks ago he was talking to 1 
Fleur Meier, the former wife\of Gardnej Cowles, the owner of Cowles ' I 

Publications. She has been spending (considerable time in Europe and she , > 
J emphasized to McCone that Buchanan’/ book is something which should not ' 
j be disregarded by U. S. author! ties /because many Europeans are accepting 
Buchanan's story as being- factual; / She stated that Buchanan has not only % 
impressed people with his book buy has also been impressive in the press 
and T. V. interviews. \ / 

McCone advised that heAthen conferred with Chief Justice Warren 
and suggested that the CommissiorA would want to examine the book very 
carefully and make certain that /all of Buchanan's allegations had been g 
adequately covered. His point was\that if the Commission did not review * 
the book, it would always be subject to some criticism and second guessing.p 
Warren commented that it might/be m the Commission's advantage to call ^ 
Buchanan for testimony. McCone toldVWarren that before such action were 
. taken, the Commission should seriously consider all the possible conse- .* 

1 *quences. He pointed out to Warren that an invitation to testify before : - 
the Commission would give Buonanan the\ideal opportunity to hold more press 
interviews solely for the purpose of propagandizing his book.

Ur. Ualley and I went over to see Ur. Lee Rankin , General Counsel 
of the President's Commission, shortly after 11 a.m. today. I took With 
me a copy of the transcript of the Director's testimony before the 
Commission, with the corrections we had made as to typographical errors, 
et cetera. I told Ur. Rankin we would be glad to go over the transcript 
with him, as it was apparent that the reporter who took down the testi- 
mony had made some mistakes and had even left out some of the thought 
in the testimony; that this was understandable as the Director spoke at £> 
a rapid rate. We mentioned that Ur. Redlich of the staff had called 
Ur. Ualley this morning to state that he thought there woro some corroc- ^ 
tions that needed to be made in the testimony, inasmuch as he had been 
present when the Director testified and the ti'anscript was not entirely 
accurate. vi,' 

• 

Ur. Rankin suggested that I leave the transcript with him so that g 

I hc could go over it personally, and ho said that he would be in touch q 

with me by Monday, 5/25/64, in the event there was a need to discuss any a 
changes. I told him that, of course, there had been no changes in the *** 
substance of the Director's testimony. Rankin said that the transcripts ^ 
of testimony will be published and, consequently, he wanted to be sure ^ 
that the testimony properly reflected the Director's thoughts. He asked g 
if the Director had gone over it, and X told him that he had and that O 
the testimony, as we had corrected it, properly represented the Director's 
testimony. He reiterated that he thought it was Important, as the 
testimony would be made public, that it should properly represent the 
Director's thoughts. I ( r ~~ — omc.cc. •• 

* NOT RECORDED 

Ur. Rankin requested that we advise* jfog §i£$$tor that he, Rankin, 

! felt that the Director had dono an excellent job '"in testifying before 
the Commission. Rankin further said, "A s you know, the Commissioners 
like the Director." “ — — — 

With reference to that portion of the tostlmony^rdg^^^g^w^th the 
Director's suggestions on tho socurity of the President, and the' memo- 
randum of 12/2/63 which wo sent a copy of to the Commission, Mr. .Rankin 
remarked that the Commission had not previously advised us 6$ the fact 
that a request had been made of Secret Service for a copy of tho memorandum 
Tpe had given to Secret Service, and the request had been denied, on the 
;instructlonsN>f Ur. Jenkins of the White House. I told Ur. Rankin that, 

AHBsCS:: (6) n V-

in view of this, it would be necessary for us to advise Mr. Jenkins 
that wo had subsequently furnished a copy of this memorandum to the 

• Commission. Me ’agreed, and suggested that we advise Ur. Jenkins that 

j the Commission had requested the Director's views on the security of the 

' President at the time the Director testified, and had requested that a 
copy of this memorandum be made available to the Commission; that in 
view of the fact that the FBI was, of course, under instructions to 
cooperate fdlly with the President's Commission, the Director furnished 
a copy to the Commission. Mr. Rankin said that if there are any 
repercussions from the White House, such repercussions will then be 
directed at the Commission, rather than at the FBI. 

Mr. Malley inquired of Mr. Rankin as to whether the Commission 
would furnish us a copy of the testimony of the two Dallas polico 
officers relative to their alleged conversation with Special Agent Hosty 
on 11/22/C3, while Hosty and Lieutenant Kevill were on their way to 
the office of Captain Fritz. 'Mr. Rankin stated that the Commission 
has been rigid in its rule that the testimony of witnesses will be 
made available only to the witnesses themselves, and it is up to the 
witnesses whether they make the transcripts available to anyone else. 

He did remark that he, Rankin, felt that the statements of Revill and 

J Detective Brian were a put-up job, particularly as Brian did not back up 

* Revill 's statement. He said, further, that Brian told the Commission 
that Revill had asked him to put some statements in Brian's memorandum 
which Brian felt he could not do. Rankin said thex*e was a division of - 
feeling on the part of the commissioners as to whether the police officers 

{ were telling a true story. Rankin said that Brian further admitted that 
he had dictated another memorandum which had been destroyed, presumably 
because it had been filled with handwritten corrections. 

In the discussion on getting copies of the transcripts of testi- 
mony of witnesses, Ur. Rankin said that Secret Service had requested 
a copy of my (Belmont's) testimony, and the Commission bad refused to 
fui*nish it, in line with its policy. I inquired why they wanted it 

I and Rankin said Secret Service is floundering somewhat with the problem 
of what to do with the Information we have sent over to them, and is ' 
seeking to establish criteria on what information they want. Therefore, 
they would like to soe what criteria we are using in disseminating this 
information. Rankin said he told Secret Service that they should ask 
the Bureau if they want this information. I told Ur. Rankin we had 
not received any request from Secret Service. 


2 



Mr. Rankin again nentionod his feeling that some persons in 
;| Secret Service are attempting to unload on tho Bureau, on the basis 
;! that if the Bureau had given them information on Oswald they would have 
I acted upon it. I asked Rankin whether this was Mr. Rowley's position, 

C and he said it was not. 

During /the Director's testimony, Allen Dulles brought up the 
subject of a book, "The Red Roses of Dallas," by Gun. T/e asked Ranlcin 
whether he had this book, and Rankin furnished us a copy. Tho author 
is Nerin S. Gun. It is 215 pages long, was printed in France, and is 
in the French language. Me have sect it to the Domestic Intelligence 
Division, with the suggestion that they check with Central Intelligence 
Agency and see if there is an English edition, so that we will not have 
to wrestle with the French language. 

With reference to the proposed trip to Dallas, which was scheduled 
for last weekend, and rescheduled for this weekend, Mr. Rankin advised 
this morning that he is considering holding a conference of FBI and 
Secret Service representatives, and his own staff, to decide whether 
such a trip is necessary, and to ‘try and curtail the* amount of work to 
bo done in Dallas if such a trip is made. 


( I must say that, from talking with Mr. Rankin today, as well as 
on previous occasions, his approach on this whole matter is objective i 

and fair, and he has been very friendly. During the discussion he i 

( advised that some of the Commission members had indicated that the J 

present duties of Secret Service should be turned over to the FBI, i 

at least in the field of protecting the President. He said that be 
i had pointed out that the Director traditionally has taken the position . i 


that the FBI should be kept a small organization and its duties and 
responsibilities should be limited, as he (tho Director) felt it is 
-highly undesirable to center too much power in any -one agency, or to 
develop what might be tei'mod a national police force. I told Mr. Rankin 
he was correct in this, and over the years the Director had sought to 
(avoid the concept of a national police force or tho centralization of 
{power. Mr. Rankin said this has not come to tho point that it is an 
issue, but it might bo that members of the Commission would again raise 
this point during the conclusion and recommendation phase of their 
report; in this case Mr. Rankin would see to it that the Director was 
consulted by the Commission. I suggested to Mr. Rankin that the simplest 
way to handle this, if it does become an issue, is for the Commission 
to send a letter to the Director, and I was suro he would express his 
views forthrightly and succinctly.

Tightens Murder Case - 1— 

By GEORGE CARTER, Stall Writer • 

Dallas police, wrapping up an "airtight" case against accused assassin Lee 
Flarvey Oswald Saturday night, matched his handwriting with that on an order 
Form for a rifle like the one which fired the fatal shots at President John F 
Kennedy, •• - 

Police also revealed they have photographs showing Oswald with the rifle 
and with the pistol recovered from him when he was arrested. 

But as police prepared to transfer Oswald, an avowed Marxist, to the 
<4*inty Jail on Sunday, they indicated there is little hope at this point of obtain* 
llg a confession of the President’s murder. 

i After the last interrogation of Oswald Saturday night, Police Chief Jesse 
Curry also announced that assault-to-murder charges have been filed against 
him in connection with the shooting of Gov. John Connally, who was riding in the 
car with President Kennedy Friday. 

Earlier murder charges were filed against Oswald for the slaying of a 
Dallas policeman, J. D. Tippit, and the assassination of the President 

“Basically, the case is ctesed^-bald Chief Curry at the final p ress c^rf sa- 
.ence cf (be night "We had a 
leood aw (his morning, and we 
have a better case tonight" '

Final ballistics reports have not 
been made to determine whether 
the rifle found in the building 
from which the fatal shot was 
fired is the same one used to 
kill the President J, 

"But I understand the report 
will be favorable ," the Dallas 
police chief said, adding later that 
the report is due Sunday. 

In another development the 
chief disclosed that police to- 
covered photographic transpar- 
encies of Oswald taken from a 
bouse In living which showed 
him with the rifle and pistol 
taken from him at the time of 
his arrest 

i fl BE MILITANT 
* In the photographs, Chief Curry 
said, Oswald is holding papers 
ion which a re visible the words' 
"Be Militant" and "The Worker."! 
I The chief said Oswald had beei^l 
lonironted with the photographs.^ 
lut had little to aay about them. I 
i Chief Curry said Oswald wily 
be put into the custody of Sheriff 
Bill Decker sometime Sunday. 

When reporters asked when the 
transfer to the county Jail would 
take place, be said, "You better 
be around here about 10 am." 

Chief CUrry said Oswald still 
has not admitted owning the rifle 
found at the warehouse. 

"I don't think we've made any 
progress in getting a confession,” 
he said.' ‘ •*' •-* ‘ 

Asked why be was pessimistic 
about obtaining a confession, the 
chief answered: "Well, we nave 
been in this business a long time, 
and you can Just tell by talking 
to some lei low*. He might have 
a change of heart, but I would 
be surprised. V * 

AID OFFER SPURNED 

Earlier Saturday Oswald ap- 
parently spumed an offer of the 
Dallas Bar Association for legal 
assistance. 

Louis Nichols, president of the 
DBA, said after a brief visit with 
Oswald at the city Jail that hi 
Jai convinced the accused assasJ 
| and self-described Marxist waj 
Jot being denie4j5*mseL_. * ; 


1 fle oiKte d Oswald ai telling him 
|his first choice as a lawyer was 
John Abt of New York City and 
his second choice would be a 
member of the American Gvil 
liberties Union. 

* If be were unable to obtain the 
aervices of these lawyers, Oswald 
reportedly told Mr. Nichols, he 
might call on the local bar as- 
toriation to help him at a later 
date. 

| ART DUBIOUS 

I United Press Internationa) re- 
ported from New York that Mr. 
Abt said Saturday night, "I don't 
see how it would be possible to 
undertake a case of this magni- 
tude." 

He spoke in an interview with! 
the American Broadcasting Sys- 
tem. 

While not flatly refusing to take 
the case, Mr. Abt noted that be 
had a "very heavy litigation 
schedule” and that undertaking 
[Oswald's defense "would not be 
! £air to my other clients.” f 

TOLD AID NEEDED 1 

I Mr. Nichols, not a criminal lava 
|er himself, said he went to th). 
Jail to see Oswald after be was : 
fold Oswald had been unable la 
obtain counsel 

But after a 3-minute visit with 
the prisoner, Mr. Nichols said be 
was convinced the man was not 
being denied counsel 

He said Oswald did not discuss 
the shooting with him. 

"He seemed perfectly rational. 
He did not appear to be defiant 
Members of his family will at- 
tempt to reach Abt" Mr. Nichols 
said. 

BROUGHT DOWN AGAIN 

A lew minutes after Mr. 
Nichols left the Jail, Oswald was 
brought downstairs to the office 
♦of Capt Will Frits, apparently 
for another round of questioning. 

The grinning prisoner, wearing 
a T-shirt, was bcscigcd by report- 
en as he was led into Capt 
Fritz' office. 

When asked if he wanted any- { 
thing, be said. "Well, I'd like a 
change of clothes. I would She 
the basic, fundamental, hygenftc 
rights like a shower" 

| As he left Capt. Fritz' office k 
1:05 pjn. after being questioned 
about an hour, Oswald still mahr 
♦Sained his Innocence. .11

^ Oswald, who once lived In Rus- 
sia and even tried to get Rus- 
sian citizenship In 1169, was* 
charged Friday night with the 
sniper assassination of President 
Kennedy and the fatal shooting 
in Osk Cliff minutes later of a 
Dallas policeman, 39-yearold JD. 
Tlppit 

Gov. ConnaBy was wounded In 
the shooting Just before 12:30 
p.m. Friday in which President 
Kennedy was slain by one or 
more rifle shots fired from & 
sixth-story window at the ear- 
ner of Elm and Houston streets. 
His condition Saturday was re- 
jported satisfactory. 

I CAUGHT IN THEATER 
f Oswald was arrested an feotfr 
Atcr after a wild scuffle with po- 
lice In an Oak Cliff theater. QE& 
&r Tippit already had been fih& 
to death at 10th and Patton streets 
to Oak Cliff. 

City detectives, Secret Service, 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
sheriff 's deputies and a represent- 
ative of DisL Atty. Henry Wade 
were all involved to the lengthy 
interrogations of Oswald. 

In late afternoon Saturday, an- 
ticipating Oswald's rumored trans- 
fer from the city Jafl to county 
Jail, hundreds of Dallasites lined 
the west side of Houston street 
near the driveway to the Dallas 
County Jail. On the opposite ride 
of Houston street at least 50 TV 
cameras moved Into range. 

Dallas Transit Co. reported that 
traffic In the area— and nearby, 
'where the President was shot— 
was ao heavy that buses were] 
tunning up to 35 minutes behind!

wald* s background, and especially 
his alleged pro-Russian and pn>!

foreign-made rifle, tome 
shells and a pistol were all sent 
to Washington Friday night for 
fingerprint checking. TV rifle 
and shells were found In the sixth- 
floor room from where the dead- 
ly shots were fired as the presi- 
dential motorcade moved toward 
Stemmons Freeway Just after 
Friday noon. TV pistol was taken 
from Oswald when be was ar- 
rested in the theater. 

Chief Curry said Lt Car! Day 
of the Police Department’s iden- 
tification bureau believed that 
partial palm prints found on a 
packing box at the sixth floor 
window were definitely Oswald's. 

Police also learned that a 15- 
vear-dd Dallas man who drove 
Oswald to work from his home in 
Irving Friday morning noticed he 
was carrying a long object 
wrapped in brown paper. It was 
the approximate length of a rifle 
and the man said Oswald told 
him it was window shades. 

J MANY QUESTIONED I 
Many witnesses were Vln? 
icstioncd by Capt. Fritz arn 
others throughout Saturday. 
Among them were believed to 
be tV driver of a bus which 
Oswald rode one block from the 
shooting scene, and a cab driver 
who may have taken Oswald to 
an address on Berkley where bs 
had a room. 

Police theorize Oswald then 
changed clothes, went outside 
and shortly encountered Officer 
Tjpplt 

Oswald was an employ* of 
Texas Book Depository, occupant 
of the seven-story building at 
Elm and Houston from wVre tbs 
idiots were fired. 

Another employe of the firm 
was Interviewed at length Satur- 
day after appearing voluntarily. 
Capt. W.P. Gannaway of the 
Police Department's Special Serv- 
ices Bureau said this man’s name 
has been in the subversive files 
of the department since 1555. He 
was not Jailed and police said 
be was not arrested. 

.Chief Curry said Oswald bid 
ivrd in Dallas about two montl t. 
Jj A controversy almost blossom d 
liturday when The Times Hers d 
le arned th at the FBI interrogate 


tesaald rmd his Russia&hosa-adft 
I cm than two weeks ago. Police 
Chief Curry said, regardless, 
Oswald had never been recorded 
by the Dallas police as either a 
subversive or a criminal. Later, 
Oiicf Curry called a press confer- 
ence to emphasize there were no 
differences between his depart- 
ment and tV FBI. 

Capt. Fritz said that Oswald, 
during interrogations and in front 
of the press as well, had asked 
for a lawyer. On one of the pris- 
oner’s many trips through the 
halls be halted suddenly before a 
TV reporter, leaned toward the 
microphone and said in a low 
voice, *T want to talk to Mr. 
Abt.” 

United Press International, Is 
a dispatch out of New York, 
identified the man as John J. Abt, 
and said: "During the 1510's and 
1950’s his name was almost 
synonymous with the legal d* 
tense of the Communist party ft 

[ e United States." I 

LETTER REVEALED j 
In the fast-moving develop 
ents. Oswald’s service record as 
a Marine aroused added interest 
A 1961 letter from tV Pentagon’s 
personnel files shed a new light 
on the Dallas crimes. 

Dated Jan. 90, 1961, it was writ* 
ten in longhand from Minsk, to 
the Soviet Union, and was signed 
by Lee Harvry Oswald. It was 
addressed to then Secretary of 
the Navy John Connally and 
asked a reversal of Oswalds un- 
desirable discharge from the Ma- 
rine Corps. 

The letter raised the question 
of whether tV primary target to 
Friday’s tragedy was Gov, Con- 
nally or President Kennedy.

RE: HARRY HAROLD ENABLE 


On June 25, 1963, Investigative Clerk JOHN P. OUNDERMANN, JR. 
checked the records regarding HARRY ENABLE at the Voters Regis- 
tration Commission, Philadelphia, Pa. These records reflected 
that HARRY ENABLE resided In an apartment on the third floor at 
330 South Eleventh Street, Philadelphia, Pa. His occupation was 
that of a salesman. He was described as a white male, 5* 4 tall, 
with brown eyes and mixed brown and gray hair. He was born 
September 3> 1897, at Philadelphia, Pa. 

During the period 1942 to 1964, ENABLE has contacted 
the Philadelphia, Pa., and the Washington, D. C., Offices of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation on a number of occasions, and has 
furnished various complaints and allegations of violations of 
the law. In most of these Instances, he was generally vague and 
sometimes Incoherent. 

On September 7, 1954, HARRY ENABLE, who stated he 
resided at 1952 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pa., contacted 
the Philadelphia Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
and advised that he had Just returned from Atlantic City, N. J., 
where he had been poisoned at Bishop* s Restaurant. He said he 
had Important Information concerning the Fascists who are trying 
to take over our Government. 

ENABLE rambled at great length concerning Fascism and 
miscellaneous matters. He stated his wlfe*s name was JULIA 
BARLOW ENABLE, to whom he had been married for twenty -one years. 

He said he had finally decided to leave her Inasmuch as he had 
discovered that the Fascist Army of America planted her In his 
home several years ago to sgy on him. 

On November 20, 1956, Assistant United States Attorney 
WARREN D. MULLOY stated that he had been advised by the Secret 
Service that ENABLE had been Jailed In Washington, D. C., by the 
Secret Service for attempting to annoy President EISENHOWER, 

* • *; 

t i< ..•('O' 51/ 3 


ErccLosum. 



MULLOY said he had been further advised by the Secret 
Service that ENABLE Is a former patient at the Byberry Mental 
Hospital, Philadelphia, Pa.; and that when KNABLE becomes 
obstreperous, he will Immediately become amenable If asked if 
he would like to go back to Byberry. 

On April 19, 1958, Mr. SAM P. HIRSCH, Manager, Floyd 
Karrlg Shoe Store, 1412 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa., 
advised the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Philadelphia, Pa., 
that on April 19, 1958, HARRY KNABLE, 5313 Germantown Avenue, 
Philadelphia, Pa., came Into his store with a package which he 
wanted HIRSCH to mall to President DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. Bie 
open package contained two pairs of sneakers and one shirt. 

HIRSCH further stated that KNABLE had been in his 
store once before, and Is apparently a "nut." He advised the 
only way he could get rid of KNABLE was to accept the package 
for mailing. 

On January 29, 1963, KNABLE appeared at the .Washington 
Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and advised 
he wished to furnish Information concerning various crimes In 
Philadelphia, Pa. He was unable to furnish any specific 
information. He mentioned he was a leader in Democratic 
politics in Philadelphia, Pa., and was an insurance broker; 
but he could not recall the name of the company for which he 
worked. He exhibited an IBM card, indicating he had a license 
to sell Insurance in the State of Pennsylvania in 1951 And 1958. 

On March 3, 1983, HARRY H. KNABIE, 330 South Eleventh 
Street, Philadelphia, Pa., called the Philadelphia Office 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and wanted an Agent 
Immediately as his shoes were burned by mustard gas. He also 
said he had additional Information to furnish before leaving 
for Washington. 

On April 5, 1983, KNABIE again appeared at the 
Philadelphia Office, and asked for the "Chief" or his assistant. 

He advised he was from Washington, D. C., and rambled on and 
on in a nonspecific manner. ' 

f I . v •'>, . . 



On May 5, 1964, Brigadier General ROBERT T. SHULTZ, 

Aide to former President EISENHOWER, advised Special Agents 
JOHN C, MURRAY and FRANK HANLON that he had received numerous 
telephone calls from HARRY ENABLE of Philadelphia, Pa. During 
these telephone calls, KNABLE claims he is a Congressional 
Medal of Honor winner; and after talking for a short time, 
becomes very abusive, at which time General SHULTZ ends the 
conversation by hanging up. 

On May 14, 1964, General SHULTZ telephonically 
advised Special Agent JOHN WILLIAM DAANE that KNABLE had attempted 
to call him that date, and had become so abusive to the telephone 
company operator, that she had broken the connection after 

advising him that General SHULTZ was out to lunch. 

* 

General SHULTZ advised that according to his records, 
the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service at the 
White House has a file on HARRY H. KNABLE. 

On May 14, 1964, WALTER YOUNG, Protective Research* 
Section, Secret Service, White House, telephonically advised . 
Special Agent JOHN WILLIAM DAANE as follows; 

ft' HARRY KAR0LI5$CNABI£, white, male, age 66 in 1964, 

5’ 3"# 140 pounds, who wears rimless glasses, has been visiting 
Washington, D. C. r , and attempting to see either the President 
or the Vice-President since 1947. Several times the Secret 
Service has had him committed as a mental case, with the last 
time being in 1958. ; 

On June 30, 1958, at a hearing under the District of 
Columbia Mental Health Act, KNABLE was found to be in need of 
mental assistance; however, he was released to the custody of 
his wife, JULIAJfeARTOW=KNABIE. KNABLE is usually well dressed, 
and sometimes wears an American Legion Uniform. 

YOUNG stated that they feel KNABIE is more of a 
nuisance than a physical threat, based principally on his sise, 
age and physical condition.

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY 


■ Memorandum Rosen to Belmont dated 5/11/64 made certain recom- j'/ . 
mendations concerning personnel to be sent to Dallas over the coming weekend 
to obtain additional technical data needed by the President's Commission. One | j 
of the items recommended was that Inspector Tom Kelley of Secret Service be 
requested to make arrangements to have an appropriate seven -passenger open v w- 
automobile available in Dallas. 


This matter was discussed with Inspector Kelley of Secret Service 
today and he advised that arrangements were being worked on today and he would • 
see to it that one of the Secret Service automobiles, seven-passenger open car, 
would be available in Dallas no later than Saturday for the work to be performed 
in Dallas. 

Kelley also advised Malley that J. Lee Rankin of the President's 
Commission had requested that he, Kelley, be available in Dallas for the work 
to be done there and also desired Secret Service Agent John Hollett, who has j 
participated in a great deal of photography and measurements for Secret Service, ] 
. be available. j [3 J 

This morning Malley received a call from Mr. Arlen Specter of the 
Commission staff who stated that Mr. Rankin was agreeable to handling a large , 
1 portion of this project on Sunday morning, May 17. He requested that the Dallas 
1 Police Department be advised that it would probably require the greater part of 
the day on Sunday to complete the project. He was desirous of knowing if this was* 
agreeable with the Dallas Police Department 

After appropriate contact with the Dallas Police Department, the Dallas 
. Office advised that the Police Department was in full agreement with handling 
’ this project on Sunday and stated it would be perfectly agreeable to utilise the 
entire day if necessary to complete the project and they would make appropriate 
ar rang em ents for handling the traffic problem. yj t , /.' ’i' J Ol/ ,

In addition to the above items, Mr. Specter desired that a dummy 

) of a size similar to that of President Kennedy be available in order that certain 
photographs and other examinations could be made, making use of this dummy. 

Such a dummy is available and will be available in Dallas in order to handle 
this project 


Mr. Specter indicated that numerous questions were being raised 
by various Commission staff members and that he was working out more details 
relative to the entire project and would like to have a conference with personnel 
who would be going to Dallas prior to any departures from Washington. He 
advised that he would notify Malley as soon as possible what date this conference 
tcould be held and the time for such a conference.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont , . • -v" •; . 

Re: Assassination of President Kennecly . •. * 

I has requested the FBI to make all the necessary arrangements for this project . 
and has directed a copy to Chief Rowley of the Secret Service in order that they 
will be aware of the request as well as to furnish any assistance that the Bureau 
might desire. If the Bureau refuses to carry out this request it places the 
Bureau in a position where considerable criticism may result. 

Li handling this request it will be necessary to utilize an automobile 
similar to the car that the President was traveling in, namely, a seven-passenger 
open car and Inspector Kelly of Secret Service has indicated that Secret Service 
will make arrangements to have such a car available in Dallas if desired. 


It will also be necessary to have available a qualified surveyor and 
In previous work done in Dall as, a county.sjurveyor, Robert H./^West, was utilized 
and arrangements for this were made by Secret Service. t y ^ 

RECOMMENDATIONS: . 


1. That Mr. Rankin be advised the Bureau will make arrangem ents 
to handle the request set forth in his letter of May 7, 1964. * If approved, the 
Dallas Office will be issued necessary Instructions for arrangements that will 
have to be made in Dallas, including the arrangements for handling traffic while 
photographs are being taken and other work is being performed. Because of 

( traffic conditions on this busy thoroughfare, efforts will be made to perform 
this work in the early morning hours of Sunday, May 17, 1964, providing it 
can be worked out with Mr. Rankin. 


<*</ 

2. That Messrs. Gauthier, Shaneyfelt, and Frazier, along with 
whatever technical assistants Messrs. Gauthiei/need. be utilized to proceed 
to Dallas to handle this project. and Shaneyfelt 

aK •

8. Inspector Kelly of Secret Service will be requested to make 
necessary arrangements to have an appropriate seven-passenger open automobile 
available in Dallas.

On 5-7-64, we received a request from the Presidents Commission 
that this Bureau make all necessary arrangements for a partial re-enac tment ■ 
of the assassination in Dallas, Texas, on May 18 and 19, 1964. This project 
specifically deals with the shots fired at President Kennedy and technical •, 
data, measurements and photographs relating thereto as developed through 
investigation. This will involve placing cars in the highway at various points 
at scene of assassination, 5 

The Commission by reference to various motion pictures taken of j| ^ 
the actual assassination itself along with other technical data previously >. 
furnished, is endeavoring to pinpoint the exact time when and location wher& 
the shots were fired and the exact location where President Kennedy and 0 
Governor Connally were when they were hit. This study will include gt 
mathematical calculations and probable trajectory of projectiles flredj^' § 

BACKGROUND: 1 

The advisability of this Bureau participating In a re-enactment hasg 
been discussed in my previous memoranda, and Mr. Belmont pointed out the 
undesirability of such action, principally due to the resultant publicity which 
will undoubtedly accompany any such venture, and our views were brought 
to the attention of Mr. Rankin. , ff£Q • f, , j 3 117 

As you are aware, J. R. Malley is currently in Dallas with members 
of the Commission and Inspector Tom Kelly of Secret Service for an on-the-spot 
inspection. He is scheduled to return sometime Saturda y, May 9 . 

ACTION: ~ —

This Commission has been making 
various motion picture films taken at the 

In this project ve have had the valuable assistance of members of 
your Bureau, particularly Inspector James R. Malle y, Inspector Ico 
Gauthier and Special Acent Lyndal A* Shaneyfelt. As a result of the 

I information obtained from these films the Commission vould like the 
cooperation of your Bureau in the performance of certain additional 
investigation at the scene of the assassination* 

I will personally be available to supervise this work and 
will have such other staff members present as may be deemed necessary* 
We vould hope to be able to perform this work in Dallas on May 18 and. 
May 19* The purpose of this letter is to set forth the steps which / / 
we feel ore necessary to properly complete this project* 

I* PROBABLE RANGE WITHIN WHICH THE FIRST TWO SHOTS OCCURRED 

Our examination of the Zapruder films indicates that 
Governor Connelly va6 hit at some point prior to frame 240* (All 
references to frames in the Zapruder films ore on the basis of a 
numbering system worked out with FBI personnel who have been working 
on this project*) Doctors familiar with the Governor* s wounds • 
concluded that after frame 236 his body was not in a position to 
have received the wound from a projectile fired from the sixth floor 
southeast corner window of the Texas School Book Depository Building* 
The Governor feels he was hit at approximately frame 230; some members 
of our staff feel that it could have been as late as 2^0* There Is 
general consensus, however, that it could not have been later th 
2k0» Governor and Mrs. Connolly also testified that the Gove rnor 
was hit by the second shot. (j tr -fzvnLr^-

The FBI laboratory examination of the Zapruder camera . "V"" 
establishes that it operates at a speed of 18-1/3 frames per second* . 
Weapons experts have testified that the minimum time required to 
operate the assassination weapon is 2-1/4 seconds* It would appear, ' 
therefore, that a minimum of 4l frames would have to elapse between ... 
the first, and second shots (18-1/3 X 2-1/4). 

The Coomission is aware that it is impossible to determine 
the exact point at which the first two shots were fired* We request 
the following on-site investigatory steps, however, in order to 

1 determine whether it was possible for a person located in the sixth 
floor southeast corner window of the TSBD building to fire two shots 
at the Presidential car, the second of which occurred no later than 
frame 240: 

(1) A point should be marked on the road corresponding 
to frame 1§9 on the Zapruder film, which is the last point at which 
the assassin could have fired from the window and still have been able . 
to fire again by frame 24 0. A car should be photographed on this spot 
from the point where Zapruder was standing so that this photograph can 
be compared with frame 199 to make certain that the location is accurate* 
This should be done with the Zapruder camera, which has been retained for 
this purpose* A Polaroid should also be used for Immediate comparison* 

(2) After a car has been placed at this point on the 
road it should be photographed from the assassination window to 
determine whether the assassin had a clear shot at the occupants 
of the rear seat, with particular reference to the tree which at 
some point blocks the view from this window* 

(3) If the car had not passed the tree at frame 199 j 
when viewed from the window, the car should be moved forward to 
the point at which there is a first clear view from the window and 
photographed at this point from both the window and from the place 
vhere Zapruder was standing so that we may determine what frame in 
the Zapruder film corresponds with this location* 

(4) If the car has in fact passed beyond the tree at 
frame 199 > it should be moved back to the point vhere it first 
cleared the tree and photographed from the window and the Zapruder 
location to establish the corresponding frame reference* 

(5) The car should also be plaoed at the point vhere 
there is the last clear shot before it goes behind the tree and 
photographed from the window and the Zapruder location to determine 
the frame reference at this point* 



(6) All the above points should be mapped on a survey* 

Lineal distances should be measured on the ground between these 4A' 

• various points* Trigonometric readings should be taken to determine 
the distances from these various points to the assassination window y/f'?. 1 ' 
and the surveyor should also determine the angle with the borizonal/vV 
which 16 made when a line Is plotted from each of these points to 
the assassination window. 

XI. PROBABLE LOCATION OF THE THIRD SHOT 

, Unlike shots one and two, the third shot has been fixed at 

a particular frame in the Zapruder films (frame 33-3)# as veil as a 
particular frame in two other films (frame 24 of the Nix film and 
frame 42 of the Muchmore film)* A car should be placed at the point 
which we believe to be the approximate location corresponding to these 
frames and then photographed from the point where the three cameramen 
were standing to establish the accuracy of this location* Distances 
should be measured from this point to the various points described in 
part I and angles and distances established between this point and the 
assassination window* The car should also be photographed at this 
point from the assassination window to establish the view which the 
assassin had when he fired the third shot* • 

III. PLOTTING TRAJECTORIES FROM THE RAILROAD OVERPASS 

From each of the ground points established in parts 1 and 
II trigonometric readings should be taken from a point on either and 
of the overpass to chart the path which a bullet would travel if firad 
from those points on the overpass to the rear seat of the car. It 
should be determined whether a bullet could reach the rear seat without 
hitting the windshield, and the angle with the horizontal which would 
be made by a bullet fired from these points to a car located at each - • . 

of the points on the ground as determined in parts I and II* i 

i 

A copy of this letter has been sent to Chief Rowley of the j 

Secret Service with a request that the Secret Service provide such 
assistance in this work as the Commission and your Bureau may require* 

The Secret Service has furnished the Commission with photographs# 
surveys and measurements which we have used in our examination of 
the films and which will no doubt be useful to your Bureau in com- 
pleting this project* 

Ve would like your Bureau to make all necessary arrangements 
for this project* Members of the Bureau assigned to this project should 
contact either Mr* Norman Rcdllch or Mr* Melvin Eisenberg of the 
Commission staff if additional information is required*

. THE^PRE SIDENT’ S COMMISSION — 

' Friday, 5/15/64, Mr. Melvin Eisenberg of The Commission's staff 
telephonically contacted me concerning our continuing problem of photographing \ 
exhibits for The Commission. He said that st aff members are now preparing > 
Commission Exhibits for submission to the Government Printing Office (GPO) C* 
looking toward the formal printing and recording of The Commission's findings. 

The Commission has accumulated a large number of exhibits many of which did > 
not originate with the FBI. Some of these exhibits are multipage documents and 
reproducing them photographically could involve substantial effort and expense. 

The purpose of Mr. Eisenberg's call Friday was to tell me of certain revised r *v 
requirements which should facilitate our photographing (reproduction) problem. ^ 

jA ‘ 3 ' . 

Previously The Commission had required three 8" x 10" photographs ^ 
of each exhibit and particularly where the exhibits were made up of a number of .• 
pages the preparation of this number of photographic enlargements presented a •*, 
substantial problem. I have previously been in touch with Mr. Eisenberg concernmg 
the problem of reproducing a large number of exhibits in a short period of time w 
and he told me he would go over the problem in detail with the GPO and furnish 3 
revised requirements. Based on Mr. Eisenberg's advice the following photographing 
(reproduction) procedures will henceforth be followed in handling Commission | >• 
requests: g . 

The Commission will require one photograph (8". x 10") of each 
nondocumentary exhibit along with two Xerox copies of such exhibit. No photographs 
of documentary-type exhibits will be required but instead three Xerox copies of 
each document will suffice.

The above requirement substantially reduces our reproduction 
problem. In any instance where we furnish a photograph of a nondocumentary 
exhibit (i. e. , object shot) we will have one additional photograph prepared as 
the Bureau's file copy along with three Xerox copies, one each for Laboratory, 
Domestic Intelligence Division and Dallas, over and above the reproductions 
furnished to The Commission. In instances where we furnish only Xerox copies 
of reproductions to The Commission we will, in addition, prepare four such 
Xerox copies for the file and for other administrative purposes. 

Personnel of the Administrative Division's Photographic Unit have 
advised that these revised reproduction procedures will substantially ease the 

photographing and reproduction problem with respect to these Commission exhibits.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont 

RE: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY 


primarily because he worked in 'the Governor’s office.” Coleman allegedly '* 
asked Shores to get in touch with him at 353 Smith Street in Detroit, Michigan. 

* • V ; A'f .• - 

Shores could not recall the name of the receptionist who ' ' 

reportedly took this information, and he also stated Coleman went to see 
U. S. Commissioner Louise O. Charlton of Birmingham, furnishing her the 
same information. U. S. Commissioner Charlton never heard of Coleman 
and never received the information alleged. 

According to Shores, on Sunday, 4-26-64, this same individual 
called him long distance from Detroit, however, he was not available but his 
wife remembers the call. . . 

Our Detroit Office has advised that the alleged address in Detroit 
for Coleman is nonexistent and that no record identifiable with one Jerry Coleman 
could be located in the Detroit area. Efforts to substantiate Shores' allegations 
negative to date. 

ACTION: 

Our Mobile Office is contacting the Governor's office to see if . 
Coleman was ever employed there and our Birmingham Office is endeavoring 
to develop additional information on this alleged incident. 

' OBSERVATIONS: 

. It would appear that the allegations made by Shores have no basis 

I in fact. It appears quite unusual that he can not recall the name of a recep tionist 
in his own office. His purpose in furnishing this information is not known 



RECOMMENDATION: 


This matter is being followed closely by the Bureau, and, when 
the results have been received, it will be appropriately reported and furnished 
to the President's Commission. .i, . 1 * rcliX*

INFORMATION CONCERNING /)' >/•** ' J, ■// )jL 

A * 

• The "Washington Post" and "Times Herald", May 21, 1954, (J 
contained an article entitled, "2;c -Kennedy Guard Charges Frameup." 
The article indicated Bolden had been suspended as an Agent of 
the Secret Service and asserted he was "Framed" by the Government 
in a payoff case because he was going to tell of heavy drinking 
among the Agents guarding President Kennedy. Mr. Tolson inquiried 
what our files showed on Bolden. . . 

/* - v , ' i : * / * * 

■ . : ' > • , * / •' . 

Bureau files contain no references identifiable with 

Bolden, other than that received in the case captioned, "Charles 

Tillman Batchelor, Aka., Et A1 . , Interstate Transportation of 

Stolen Property, Master Check Case - Conspiracy ." Subjects of 

the Batchelor case and a Secret Service case are close associates. 

• • 

The case investigated by the Bureau involves passing of 
$100,000 worth of counterfeit Eank of America Travelers Checks in 
17 field divisions and Canada. The Secret Service case concerns 
passing of counterfeit Series E, D. S. Savings Bonds. Indictments 
were returned May 8, 1964. Seven subjects were arrested by the 
Bureau and five other subjects were arrested by Secret Service. 

There were no joint arrests, but arrangements were made to execit© 
the arrests at the sane time on May 9, 1964. 

Bolden is a Secret Service Agent assigned at Chicago, 

; Illinois, who has been accused of attempting to obtain $50,000 from 
! Joseph Spagnoli, one of liie subjects of the Secret Service case, 
in return for access to Secret Service reports. Spagnoli, who was 
on bond after his arrest by Secret Service on May 9, 1964, con- 
tacted the Chicago Office of the Bureau and claimed he had been 
approached to pay $50,000 for access to Secret Service records. 

U. S. Attorney, Chicago v/as advised and requested that Bureau con- 
duct no investigation. The U. S. Attorney referred the natter to 
Secret Service and subsequently a conference was hold in the U. S. 
Attorney's Office with the SAC, Chicago, FBI, and the supervising 
Agent of Secret Service in Chicago, Mauricc^-Martineau-; — -At this

conference it was disclosed Spagnoli also contacted Secret 
Service and furnished then a paragraph excerpt from a Secret 
Service memorandum. This paragraph involved the Secret Service 
case and Spagholi and had been given Spagnoli as evidence of the 

ability to produce Secret Service reports. 

. * 

Secret Service requested authority to conduct investi- 
gation qf this matter, and the U. S. Attorney agreed. Frank Jones $ 
subject of another Secret Service counterfeiting case, was 
identified as the one who contacted Spagnoli. Jones and his 
com.non-law v/ife, Jean Carpenter, were arrested by Secret Service 
on May 18, 1964, and implicated Bolden. Spagnoli and Jones 
testified before a Federal Grand Jury concerning this matter on 
May 19, 1964. 

! Bolden was also arrested on May IS, 1964, by Secret 

Service for his participation in this bribery attempt. Kis bond 
was set at $3500, and he was released on his own recognizance. 

Bolden held a television and press conference at his 
home. on May 20, 1964. He denied the charges against him. He 
alleged he was being "framed" because he planned to testify before, 
the "Warren Commission," concerning laxity of Presidential guards/*' /ft I 
which involved drinking, absence from posts, and misuse of Govern- 
ment automobiles. Bolden also claimed the agent in charge of the 
1 investigation against him (not named) was "once investigated 
I by the FBI for Communist' links." (Bureau files contain no such 
1 reference to rtineau.) 

U. S. Attorney Ilanrahan on a live telecast stated he 
had complete confidence in Secret Service Agents and denounced 
the allegations of Bolden. Ilanrahan questioned why Bolden remained 
silent from 1961 until now to make these charges, pointing out it 
would have been his duty to immediately report these allegations.

This is for information.

^RESIDENT KENNEDY 

/. A?hu.J~ 




Press items 5/21/64 indicate that Abraham Bolden, a Secret Service 
Agent charged in Chicago with trying to sell a Government report indicated he 
was being framed because he intended to reveal details of heavy drinking and 
general laxity among agents assigned to President Kennedy. Bolden staled he > 
was going to tell the Warren Commission regarding the alleged derelictions on 
the part of such Secret Service Agents. The attached teletype from Chicago contains 
information concerning this matter.' 

This morning Mr. Howard W2llCns of the President's Commission 
called referring to tlie publicity given Bolden's statement regarding laxity on 
the part of Secret Service Agents and Bolden's statement that he intended to 
furnish this information to the Commission. Mr. WilUns staled that inasmuch as 
Bolden's statements indicated malfeasance in connection with the protection of the 
President, he desired that Bolden be interviewed by Bureau Agents, and a complete 
detailed statement be obtained from him giving all specifics in his possession. He 
particularly desired Bolden to be questioned concerning any derelictions on the part 
of Secret Service Agents in connection with the President's visit to Dallas, but in 
addition wanted all other details concerning alleged derelictions which Bolden may 
have. „ . 

\ Wiltfns stated he had talked to United States Attorney Edward 

Hanrahan in Chicago who had no objection to the interview of Bolden but suggested that 
prior to conducting the interview the interviewing Agent clear it with Bolden's 
attorney, George Howard, 3255 West Roosevelt Road, Chicago; telephone number 
CR 7-6100. ‘ ...” 


\ V^CLCSt% 1Wns requested the interview be conducted today In order that the 
Commission can make a determination whether Bolden has ^information which wou

In view of Bolden’s penchant for publicity he could very well 

I publicize this interview. If interview approved, recommended that SAC Johnson * 
be instructed to answer any press inquiries with the statement that Bolden was 
interviewed at the request of the President's Commission, and make no further ^ 


comment.

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY 

VISUAL AIDS 

As set forth in memorandum Mr. Rosen to Mr. Belmont 5-21-64, 
ference was helcf in Mr. Rankin r s office at which time it was decided that a field trip be 
made to Dallas where certain technical information could be further developed at the 
assassination site. Mr. Rankin requested that the manikin which was prepared by the 
Bureau's Exhibits Section at the request of the Commission be made available in Dallas 
(see attached photograph). The manikin is contained in one wooden crate and will be 
transported to Dallas along with the Secret Service follow-up car. Mr. Rankin feels that 
all of the props necessary to carry on a re-enactment of the shooting sequence should be 
available at the site; however, these props will only be utilized where absolutely necessary 

It is the desire of the Commission to complete this field assignment with the 
least amount of publicity. It is estimated that it will require at .least Sunday, Monday and 
possibly Tuesday to complete all of the work which the Commission desires done at the 
site. . . 

Exhibits Specialist Roy A. Rose is accompanying Special Agent L. L. 

Shaneyfelt of the Laboratory to Dallas today, 5-22-64 for the purpose of handling pre- ; 
liminary details which will insure a smooth operation on Sunday morning when the work 
will begin at approximately 6:00 A. M. I am arranging to fly to Dallas on Saturday 
evening, 5-23-64 along with Inspector Malley to be available to Mr. Rankin and the Com- 
mission in Dallas while this work is being performed.

that at this time the TXFP1TS may have received their mail 
on a rural route out of Depart, Texas. 

Judge REED also stated that he had known that J. D. 
TIPPIT had attended the Veterans Administration Vocational 
School held in Clarksville, Texas, in the early 1950 's. 

On May 15, 1964, Mrs. I LA MAE MCRCNEY, Secretary tc

September 18, 1924. There was no place of birth listed and 
Mrs. MORONEY pointed out that Russell Chapel, which is no 
^longer in existence, was very near Annor.a_»_^^xas , and it was 
very possible that J. D. TIPPIT was C probabl yj>bcrn in that area. 

A check was made by Mrs. MORONEY into the records of 
Red River County Vocational School, which was sponsored by the 
Veterans Administration, and these records reflect that J. D. 
TIPPIT, Veterans Administration Nu-mber C-15 430 214, enrolled 
in the school on January 14, 1950, and discontinued his training 
June 11, 1952. The reason for the discontinuance of the edu- 
cation was "Moved to Dallas”. J. D. TIPPIT followed the 
training of "General Farming" and his address, at this time, 
was listed as Route 1, Deport, Texas, vfa^re he was self-employed 
on a few acres of land.

Mrs. MORONEY also stated there waa a registration card 
for J. D. TIPPIT at the Fulbright, Texas, Figh School, but 
there were no records located. Fulbright la in Red River

the Paratroopers, from July 21, 1944, through June 30, 1946, 
and had Army Serial Number 386 31 821. 

- . « f - ‘ 

As a result of this marriage, the TIPPITS had three

.-""they moved Qto)near the email farming community of Lone star# 
Texas, where her husband attempted to raise cattle from then 
until June 1952. In June 1952 they moved to 3115 Desseau, 
Dallas, vtyere they lived until November 1953. For about a 
month after moving back to Dallas, her husband was employed 
as a carpenter's helper and at a steel company doing odd Jobs. 
In July 1952 he went to work as a patrolman for the Dallas 
Police Department. 

In November 1953 they moved to a residence at an 
unrecalled number on Woodin Street, Where they stayed about 
a month. They then moved to a house, number unrecalled, on 
Fordham Road, Where they resided until June 1954, at which 
time they moved to a house, number unrecalled,' on Brooklyn

1919 Glenfield, where they resided untlXilovember 1961. This 
house is still owned by Mrs. TIPPIT and is being rented by her

through the tenth grade in school and then attended a Veterans 
Administration-sponsored school at Bogata, Texas, . during ,'a tine 
and resided at Lone Star, Texas. 

The TIPPITS have unlisted telephone numbertcA 4-2294J 
and have had it since they moved into their present rESidence 
in November 1961. They had obtained unlisted service because 
J. D. TIPPIT# many tiroes# would be working at night and dis- 
gruntled people to whom he had given traffic citations would 
call and complain to Mrs. TIPPIT about her husband having 
given them a ticket.

at Austin's Barbecue on West Illinois Avenue every Friday and 
Saturday night from lOtOO P.M. until 2t00 A.M. He had been so

1 .V fellow police officers and that the only people she and her 
^ husband associated with other than other police officers and 
their wives were relatives. 

J. D. TIPPIT had a great fondness for fishing, but*, 
due to his work, had been unable to do much fishing during the 
past two years. During the summer of 1963 he had taken up 
water skiing whenever he had the opportunity. The reason he 
was working at two extra Jobs was that the TIPPITS needed money 
to pay off the extra bills they had incurred When they purchased 
their present residence. 

Whenever her husband was not working, he would spend 
all of his time at home, either working in the yard, playing 
with his children, or having friends over. Be liked to listen

his father or brothers. Mrs. TIPPIT recalled that her husband 
had voted for JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY in the election of 1960. *

TIPPIT* ' ; f 

t • 5 * 

/ i 

/ 

OWENS has been employed by the Dallas/ Police Depart- 
ment for twenty-three and one-half years an<^has known J. D. 
TIPPIT since about 1952, When TIPPIT came to work at the de- 
^/partment. OWENS has been TIPPIT 's immediate supervisor for 
about ten years. "Tv 1 ,. 

On November 22, 1963, TIPPIT was assigned, alone, to 
patrol District 78, Which is an area bordered by the Trinity _ 
River on the east and northeast, Southerland Avenue on the 
northwest, Sunnyvale and Keats Streets on the west, and Loop 
12 or Ledbetter on the south. Sergeant OWENS explained that 
assignment of officers to an area does not restrict them to 
that area, in cases of emergency, and, due to the extreme 
emergency of November 22, 1963, numerous patrol units were 
assigned to different areas. Sergeant OWENS cited, for example, 
that units assigned to Districts and 81 had been sent to the 
downtown area of Dallas immediately after the shooting of 
President KENNEDY. According to Sergeant OWENS, Officer TIPPIT 
had gone home to eat lunch, vfoich was a normal and approved 
procedure, at about noontime. Sergeant OWENS advised he could 
not furnish any information as to vfoen or how TIPPIT' s assign- 
ment from District 78 had been changed as he, OWENS, had gone 
to lundh and had not returned during the time that TIPPIT '• 
assignment had been changed. 

TIPPIT had been assigned to District 78 for about six 
months to a year and had previously been assigned to patrol • 
Districts 83 and 84 for three years. His assignment in each 
case was to patrol the area. 

OWENS described TIPPIT as a morally upright person 
and a person about Whom he had never heard anything derogatory. 
Sergeant OWENS rated TIPPIT as an average officer in work

performance, vfoo was well-liked, used good common 6ense and, - , 

as such, was a "good officer". According to OWENS, TIPPIT 
had off-duty, part-time Johs at Austin's Barbecue and Stevens 
Park Theatre and, because of this, "didn't have time to do any 
wrong." TIPPIT was a devoted family man, vfoo spent What free 
time he had either at home or with relatives. TIPPIT was well- 
liked by all the other officers. OWENS did not know of any 
outside associates of TIPPIT and it appeared that the only 
associates he had were other police officers. TIPPIT appeared 
to be resigned to the fact that, because of his limited edu- 
cation, he would be unable to advance very far within the 
Police Department, and TIPPIT appeared satisfied with his work. 
OWENS stated he believes TIPPIT took promotional examinations, 
but had no information as to the results, but believes that the 
lack of promotion was due to a lack of education. 

OWENS was of the opinion TIPPIT had always been assigned 
to the Oak Cliff and West Dallas areas. 

OWENS described TIPPIT as a quiet, shy person and he 
never heard TIPPIT discuss politics or political personalities. 

OWENS was unable to furnish any information concerning 
TIPPIT’s outside activities or leisure activities. He did de- 
scribe TIPPIT as the most honest, straightforward, morally up- 
right, family-loving man he, OWENS, had ever known. He was a . 
good officer Who liked his job and tried to do a good job. 

OWENS stated he never heard TIPPIT mention either JACK 
RUBY or LEE HARVEY OSWALD or ever mention having been in any r*

use another officer’s name he had met When talking to officers, 
and RUBY never mentioned J. D. TIPPIT to OWENS. RUBY never

Our files show that identical information was originally >' ' 

received from the Los Angeles Office on 11-22-63. This matter 
was run out and additional information was received that an * • •'/ • 
associate of ’Browns by the name of Walter Sobolewski, who was 
at that time Browrfs roommate, 1841 Lamont Street, had contacted 
us and described that thi-ee armed men had come to his apartment 
on 11-27-63, threatening that they were going to shoot President 
Johnson if he followed through 6n former President Kennedy’s..*-., 
program and also "get" Sobolewski and his roommate, if they • 
didn’t stop fighting communism. A letter was also received from 
Brown which was postmarked November 28, 1963, and was merely a 
follow up of the phone call previously made at 3 AM, the same 
day to the Bureau. All available information concerning Brown 
and his roommate has been previously furnished to Secret Service. 
SA Homer R. Hauer, WFO, was telephonically advised at 3:30PM, 
4-22-64 to discontinue investigation, and that copy of -teletype 
will be furnished by mail. No further action is necessary in this 
matter. • . . . »*•.*. ... .,

Johnson advised that the press was asking him to confirm or deny

In connection with the interview scheduled for 1:30 p. m. this date with * 

Abraham Bolden, the Secret Service agent we were scheduled to iinrerview at that time\ 
at the request of the President's Commission concerning his allegations of derelictions 
on the part of Secret Service agents, SAC Johnson of Chicago, at 3:30 p.ra. (Wash- 
ington time), advised as follows: 

Bolden and his attorney, George Howard, appeared at the Chicago Office 
and the attorney stated that Bolden would make no statement at this time. Howard 
stated he had given the matter very careful thought; that Bolden had made certain 
statements prior to Howard's becoming his attorney with which Howard was not 
aware; that it was his duty to take care of his client's interests; that his client was 
still an agent of the Secret Service and would make no statement. Howard continued 
that Bolden was to be arraigned on May 28, 1964, in connection with his arrest by 
Secret Service and that any statement he might make at this time may affect this 
case. Howard stated that he may change his mind in the future and if so he will 
let the Bureau know. .1 

.j 

With regard to any press inquiries which he may receive, SAC Johnson was ^ 
referred to Mr. Deloach's office, which office advised that in the event of a press 
1 inquiry, the SAC should state that Bolden and his counsel appeared at the Chicago ^ 
[Office and his counsel advised that Bolden had no statement to make at this time. ^ f

Joseph P. Grinnan, Dallas independent oil man. At request" of 
the President’s Commission, we interviewed Grinnan 4-20-64 
to determine names of the contributors to this ad. Grinnan -/ 
identified Bright, Crissey and Hunt as main contributors. We 
disseminated results of our interview with Grinnan to the 
Commission and the Commission by letter 5-12-64 requested we 
interview Bright, Crissey and Runt re their knowledge of the 
ad and identities of anyone else who so contributed. ..Each of 
these 3 men admitted contributing to the ad. Bright fc Crissey 
indicated others also contributed to the ad, but they declined 
to furnish the identities of such individuals. . ^

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT 
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, 
NOVEMBER 22, 1963. DALLAS. TEXAS 


**</ : -’V *-*' 

' • 4 *V,-> J 


On May 15, 1964, the Dallas 0££lce of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation received the following quoted communi- 
cation from Mrs. MARK E. MARTIN in an envelope postmarked 
May 14, 1964, at Hominy, Oklahoma, bearing no return address s 


* To Whom It May Concern 


"The zapruder film on the assassination of President 
Kennedy offers evidence that the President and 
Governor Connally were shot from a grassy knoll to 
the right of the Presidential limousine by an auto- 
matic rifle (or rifles) • 


"It is difficult to understand why the people in 
possession of this film do not offer it for exami- 
nation to all citizens able to prove a legitimate 
interest. 




•History will not be influenced by any opinion 

contrary to this evidence regardless of the 'blue- 

ribbon source.* 


■Sincerely, 

Mrs. Mark E. Martin and Children

NOTE: 


. ?Vt f * 


This is the 12th letter to the Commission on Martin, 

SAC Letter 64-23B dated 4-28-64 alerted the field to her<?^!Stv; 
campaign of vilification of the Director and the FBI, Martin' 
has been described as a "bright nut,” and since the assassination 
has been 'conducting her own investigation. 


*<“V 


Re airtel from Dallas enclosed a letterhead memorandum 
in which Martin alleges the "Zapruder" film of the assassination 
offers evidence that the President and Governor Connally were 
shot from a grassy knoll to the right of the Presidential . 
motorcade by an automatic rifle,. She also states she cannot 
understand why this film has not been examined. 


I 


* 8 


Of course this is utter nonsense. The Zapruder film, 
if anything, verifies the fact that the President was shot from 
the rear and has definitely been examined in minute detail by 
the FBI and the President's Commission. In fact, each frame 
of this film has been enlarged, made into individual slides, . 
and is the basis for the Commission's time study of the sequence 
of shots. . • •

his office on Hay 20. 1964. The anonymous letter and the 
envelope in which it was sent are being examined by the

significance of the Arizona license number and any I 
pertinent Information developed as a result of our 
inquiries will be made available to you.

SUBJECT: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY ' 

On May 8 ^nd 9, 1964, l^embers of the. President's Commission, ^^4 
Senator John Shermaiy*Cooper; John >McCloy; Allen, ‘Dulles; .^President's 
staff membef* David^EL^len; accompanied by Inspector Tom/Kelley of Secret Service^ 
and Malley, visited a number of locations in Dallas relating to the assassination ofo 
President Kennedy. No difficulties arose of any nature which would affect the / -• •• ^ 
Bureau. - *7 v y . .. j V v- ‘ 

DETAILS : ' V ’■ ' ;■ c-'*-; 

The above-mentioned group visited Parkland Memorial Hospital and 
observed ih detail the room where President Kennedy was given emergency treat- 
ment and also asked the head nurse who was on duty on 11/22/63 several questions 
concerning the type of stretcher used, where the bullet was found, and other 5 
miscellaneous questions. * t } a 

The group next visited the area at the Texas School Book Depository^ 
(TSBD) building and observed in considerable detail the park area adjoining the g , 
Elm Street thoroughfare which runs in front of the TSBD. The group was interested 
particularly in the site from which the /Ab raham/zapruder film jwas taken and al^ 7 *; 
went out into the middle lane of traffic in order to observe what could be seen frQn'- 
the sixth floor window from which it is believed Oswald shot the President In § 
addition, the group inspected the TSBD from all sides and looked at the various at* 
exits by which an individual might have left the building. A more detailed inspeSion , 
of the TSBD interior of the building was made on Saturday morning, May 9, 1964. v - 

Observations were made from the railroad overpass and numerous , 

I comments were made about the distances involved and the fact that it would be 
almost impossible for a shot to be fired from the overpass without hitting the wind- 
shield of a car. * 4 

U ’ Y ' 1 . . ■■■■■ 

The group visited the ( Buell Wesley Frazier residence, this being the 
residence of the individual Oswald rode with from Dallas to Irving and returned 
on weekends. They also visited the residence of Michael and Ruth^Paine, it being noted

Memo to Mr. Belmont from A. Rosen 
Re: Assassination of President Kennedy 




Mrs. Marina Oswald was residing with Mrs. Paine at Irving, Texas. On the 
occasion of this visit neither the Fraziers nor the Paines were at their residences.^# 




A stop was made at the residence of Mrs. Johnson, who operates 
the rooming house at 1026 Beckley Street, where Oswald had been living in Dallas 
at the time of the assassination. . . .• 

J .IX' ^ . ■ .V - v 

A detailed inspection was made of the location on tenth street near 
Patton Street where Police Officer^Tippit was shot by Oswald. A check was also 
made of the Texas Theater where Oswald was located by Dallas police officers 
following the shooting of Officer Tippit. } « 


Personal calls were made on Erik - Jonsson, present Mayor of Dallas, 
and president of the Dallas Citizens Council which was the principal sponsor of 
President Kennedy’s visit to Dallas. Mayor Jonsson described in considerable detail 
the various considerations which were gone into concerning President Kennedy’s visit 
and the fact that there was some speculation on the part of GovernorTConnally as to 
whether the President should or should not visit Dallas. V- , r - 

TV . ' * 

The members of the Commission insisted on visiting for a short time 
with members of the U. S. Attorney’s office staff and also called on W illiamV A1 exander , 
First Assistant in the Dallas County District Attorney’s office, and James^Bowie of 
the District Attorney’s staff. Henry Wade, the District Attorney, was out of the city 
at the time this call was made. During this visit Mr. Alexander mentioned that one 
of the psychiatrists had recently visited with Jack Ruby in his cell for a period of * 
several hours and advised that Ruby is completely disenchanted with the defense 
attorneys who handled his case and is alleged to have stated that he wanted to take ^ 
the stand in his own behalf during his trial but was not permitted to. Ruby is alleged 
to have remarked that had he been permitted to testify he would have told the court 
| that he had no connection of any kind with Lee Harvey Oswald, had never seen the 
1 man before, and that he shot Oswald only because he wanted to be a hero. 

't • • J' • ; " ;v 

A personal visit was also made to Chief of Police'-Curry and Captain Will 
/Fritz of the Dallas Police Department. Detailed observations wore made at the police 
department of where Oswald was detained in the police department jail and the route 
which was taken by Oswald from the jail to the police department garage where he was 
shot by Ruby. ... . . 

\ ^ On Saturday morning, May 9, 1964, State Attorney General Waggoner 

*;"Carr appeared at the hotel and greeted Commission members. He stated he would like 
to render any assistance possible to them while they were in Dallas on Saturday and he 
stayed with members of the Commission until they completed their observations.

*_ : ^ f 


A detailed observation was made of the interior of the TSBD Building, 
he Commission members were particularly interested in seeing the ease with > 
hich shots could be fired from the window at a car passing on Elm Street down below; 
Iso, the fact that when standing on the fifth floor exactly beneath the window which iw 
swald utilized, it was possible to hear empty shell cases hit the floor when dropped, 
t was also observed that with the windows open on both the fifth and sixth floor, it 
ls possible to hear the bolt action of a similar type rifle when the firing of the gun 
as simulated. In this connection, two colored boys furnished information to the . • 
ffect that they had heard what appeared to be rifle shells hit the floor and the bolt - - 
ction of the gun on November 22, 1963, at the time the shots were fired at President 
ennedy. - 

The Commission members commented that they felt the firsthand \ 
inspection had been of considerable value in that it firmly resolved in their minds ;■ 
any questions they had previously had. They stated that while they had seen photo- 
graphs and read results of interviews, the firsthand inspection definitely eliminated 
any questions they had in their minds. 




1 


' During a conversation with Staff member David Belen, Belen indicated 
that Lt. v ReviLl of the Dallas Police Department would be called before the Commission 
in Washington for testimony in view of the information which was set forth in a 
memorandum indicating that Agent Hosty had made remarks to the effect that the „ 

FBI had knowledge of possible violence on the part of Oswald. Belen stated the 
Commission definitely felt Agent Hosty's testimony was completely satisfactory 
regarding his actions but that the affidavit of Revill was on record with the Commission 
and this matter needed to be clarified by having him testify before the Commission. 

Submitted for information. "

subject: " ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT v ‘ f ^> 3^1 ! f , < 

The Friday, May 22, 1964, issue of the "New York' Herald Tribune,” 

Page 9, lias a full page ad w ith a four line headline reading, "God, I hope it isn*t 
Oswald in the picture. But I want it established beyond any doubt at all. . . " Beneath the 
caption is a picture of a roll of camera film and then the following statement, "This 
Sunday the Herald Tribune will publish what is probably the most controversial photo- 
graph of the decade. *' 

The advertisement states that the photograph was taken a split second 
after President Kennedy was shot, shows him through the windshield, his left hand raised 
to his throat. (This is apparently the Associated Press photograph which has been widely 
publicized.) In the background, the, advertisement continues, is the Texas School Book 
Depository, in the doorway of which stands a man bearing a resemblance to Lee Harvey * 
Oswald. The ad points out that the FBI said this is not Oswald but that a "N ew York ’ • 
Herald Tribune" reporter named Donv*Bonefede has talked to a New Yorker (not identified) 
who wonders, has doubts and believes the full story has not been told. 

1 ' 11- 
The "Herald Tribune" will print the picture, enlarged, this Sunday i£«iJte 

New York magazine section. v - 

ACTION TAKEN: - f ^ ' 

. ‘ 3 < 

We here and at Dallas have absolutely "no commented" this matter today 

and will continue so doing. SAC Shanklin of Dallas telephoned and told Wick at 1:40^). m. 

I he is quite certain the photograph is that taken by Associated Press, which shows.ffillie 
Knowlana'Lovelady in the background. The FBI talked with this man long ago. HeTs 
employed still at the Texas School Book Depository and as recently as two weeks ago 
members of the press were taking his picture and ccmmati^on his resemblance to Lee 
Harvey Oswald. Lovelady told newsmen he was getting tired of being bothered. 

\ 

SAC Shanklin stated that a "Newsweek" representative in Dallas has now 
called the Dallas Office and said he understands the FBI has Lovelady in custody and will 
not permit pictures to be taken of him. _ REC* 33 / . / , —

DeLoach to Mohr Memorandum, 5/22/64 
RE: ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT 


Wick instructed Shanklin to tell ’’Newsweek" and other callers on this 
matter that the FBI has not taken any one into custody and is not prohibiting any one 
from being photographed. We will answer the query here the same way, if asked. 


We will continue no comment. This’ is an obvious attempt by the 
magazines and 'newspapers to increase circulation through sensationalism.

EDWARD POST, Director, of Admissions, Grantham School 
of Elect r oh i c s ',". 8 2 1 19th Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. 
advised SA JEROME E. VEIGLE on November 26, 1963 that he, 

POST, is employed as Control Board Engineer for WOL Broad- 
casting Station, 2000 P Street, N.W. 

POST informed he was on duty at this radio station 
on Saturday evening, November 23, 1963, and Sunday evening, 
November 24, 1963. He said that around 8:00 p.m. on either 
November 23, 1963 or November 24, 1963, WOL was presenting a 
taped broadcast at Dallas, Texas between an unknown commentator 
and an unknown newspaper correspondent. This broadcast, 
according to POST, concerned an alleged master plot originating 
in Europe or Rumania to assassinate the late President JOHN F. 
KENNEDY. ...... 

POST stated that after about one minute of this 
broadcast it was discontinued and, as far as he knows, nothing 
more was presented regarding it. 

POST informed WOL is a Mutual station. He said he 
received five or six telephone calls, after this program was 
discontinued, from persons inquiring as to why the broadcast 
was discontinued. . 

EDWARD POST, Granthatn School of Electronics, telephone 
number ST 3-3614, was recontacted by SA HOMER R. HAUER on 
May 14, 1964. He said he believes the broadcast referred to 
was a regularly scheduled newscast of the Mutual Broadcasting 
System. He said this broadcast was not a taped presentation 
of WOL Broadcasting, but was being transmitted through the WOL 
facilities. POST said he believes this program was originating 
from Mutual facilities located in the Sheraton Park Hotel, 
Washington, D. C. 

CHARLZs'wARREN, Manager and Bureau Chief, Mutual - 
Broadcasting System (MBS), Sheraton Park Hotel, 2660 Woodley ' 





WPO 89075 
2 


Road, N.W. advised on May 15, 1964 his office has one copy 
of a master tape recording all programs transmitted by MBS 
on November 23 and 24, 1963. 

WARREN stated this tape does not contain time ; 

checks, therefore, it would be impossible to pinpoint the . 1 

exact time a specific item was broadcast; however, he said J 

an educated estimate could be made. 

WARREN informed he would make this tape available for 
review at the MBS studios, if such were desired. 

WARREN advised a log is normally maintained recording 
any interruptions of broadcasts. He said the logs reflect the 
time of the interruption and reason therefore; however, he ' 

stated these logs ore usually not kept accurately during 
"pressure" periods such as that immediately following the 
assassination of President KENNEDY. 

WARREN states the log reflecting any interruptions 
during November 23 rnd 24, 19C3 would be maintained by ^JOSEPH, 

F. !ksATI NC.,. MB 3 Vice President in Charge of Programming, New 
York City. ) j _

LO .UIS-C^-REGGIO f _. Studio Supervisor, Mutual Broad- 
casting System, Sheraton Park Hotel, made available various ? 
tapes recording broadcasts of the Mutual Broadcasting System 
(MBS) on November 23 and 24, 1963. REGGIO advised these tapes 
are records of broadcasts of the various presentations of MBS 
regarding the assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY. 

He said these tapes do not record various musical presenta- 
tions that were broadcast during the four days on which 
special programs were offered. 

A review of the msterial recorded on spool number 17 
disclosed this tape pertains to broadcasts made between 
4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on November 23, 1963. Spool number 18 
is a recording of broadcasts made after 8:00 p.m. on November 
23, 1964. This spool (number 18) begins with a newscast at 
8:00 p.m., which was followed by a twenty- five minute special 
program. REGGIO advised both the newscast and the special 
program originated in MBS studios in New York City. 

A review of material on spool number 26, recorded 
on November 24, 1963, determined that an interruption 
occurred in a broadcast that was being made shortly after 
8:00 p.m. on November 24, 1963. This broadcast that was 
being transmitted was a representation <f a program that was 
originally broadcast at 5:05 p.m. on November 24, 1963. The 
broadcast was a conversation between news commentato r GUY _ 
/WALLACE^ £ MBS in New York City anctBOB^JET, who is a com- 
mentator associated with radio station WRR, Dallas, Texas, 
an MBS affiliate. The conversation pertained to the various 
events that occurred following the shooting of LEE HARVEY 
OSWALD. 

This program was interrupted when a direct broad- 


cast from the Capitol Rotunda pre-empted the transmission 
facilities. The broadcast from the Rotunda reported the visit

of Mrs. KENNEDY to the area where President KENNEDY'S body 


was then located. 

REGGIO approximated the times of the various 
broadcasts that were reviewed on the basis of programs that 
were transmitted and taped. 

It is noted no taped broadcast was found that meets 
the description of that furnished by EDWARD POST. The only 
interruption of a broadcast, made around 8:00 p.m. on 
November 23 or 24, 1963, is that located and reported above.

U . (J 

F/)rj>j.'ccks after President Kennedy's 
death, well-informed conversations in 
New York, Washington and Dallas 
turned on the identity of the man 
I pictured above. The FBI says it is not . . 

Lee Harvey Oswald. But one New , 
.Yorker is still wondering ... 


,SJ T " * . . • 

One day last %v int cr^ Joi) cs jTfa r r is, J! t -walked into 
^ froublcday Book Shop on Fifth Avenue between 
fith and 57th Streets. He picked up one book after 
noihef, each time flipping the pages in a somewhat 
■sinierestcd manner. Time was not of the essence to 
oik* Harris. A member of a prominent theatrical fam- 
S (his mother is actress Ruth Gordon and his 
either Jed Harris), and an occasional theatrical 
■re-htCcf in his own right (Do Rc Mi, Billy Goat Eddy), 
has ample means. During his meandering in Douhlc- 
Uy'i Harris came across a special magazine issue 
died in black letters. Four Dark Days ih History — $ 1 
ollcctor*s Cof>y — A Photographic History of President , 
Zfuaedyi Assassination. 

Harris, who had met John F Kennedy on a couple 
I'f occasions, thoughtfully leafed through the pages, 
f* her* arc photographs of the smiling, handsome Prcs- 
hUnl and his wife, the cheering crowds, the hand- 
b«*k«. Then, rather abruptly, the fallen President is 
liown photographed through the limousine's windshield. 

1 is left arm is raised to his throat and hi is beginning 
* lurch forward. The xvhitt- , wnd oU ,;^.; fc b 

rcacbmg wl to him. To the left of the President T*nv- 
ernor John Connally is slumping over onto his side He, 
too, has been hit. Two Secret Service agents on the 
limousine behind have already swung alxrnt to sec 
where the shots originated. The faces of the crowd, 
unaware of what is happening before their eyes, arc 
fixed with smiles. 

Suddenly, Harris' attention was drawn to one of 
the spectators far in the distant background, standing 
in the doorway of* the Texas School Book Depository. 
The blurted face, to Harris, seemed to be mocking him. 

It couldn't be. But there it was: the high forehead, deep* 
set eyes, tapering jawlinc, even the set of the mouth. 
The resemblance to Lee Harvey Oswald was incred- 
ible. And if the man in the doorway was Oswald, who, 
then, had fired the bullets which killed the President? 

Harris paid for the magazine and went home. For 
days Jic did nothing. It was January; almost two futt 
months had. passed since the assassination. Sxho-yrs* he 


|io trx^jQ jcCnJc findings of the bill, the .Tn^vsjatc 
investigators and the Dallas police? All agreed that 
* Oswald had triggered the fatal shots from the sixth 
floor of the warehouse. * . 

- Finally, the picture and its potential significance 
J l*camc an obsession. Harris became a hunter in search 
of answers. Who was the spectator peering out of the 
, doorway? The authorities obviously lnrlicvcd it was not 
Oswald, but could they fnnw it? He began his quest 
with the magazine, Fpur^Du rk\J)ays tn_ / / i story. It 
listed the publisher as “Special Publications, Inc., f>627^ 
Hollywood Blvd., Ix>s Angclei~2S, Calif.** Harris tele- 
phoned the office and was informed the photo had Ikch 
circulated by Associated Press Wirephoto and could l>c 
found at Wide World Pictures, the commercial outlet 
for AP with headquarters in Rockefeller Center. “J 
went over to Wide World," Harris recalls, “and the)* 
bad stacks and stacks of assassination pictures. I 
finally found a wirephoto of the picture I was Joking 
fo r, paid $3 for it and left" 

JI«L_tnak the picture to a detective fripud who 
dabbled in photography to see if it could Ik enlarged. 
The detective suggested that he obtain a positive copy 
of the photo. "Four or five days later I went hack to 
Wide World and told them 1 had a wirephoto picture 
and wanted a positive print made from the original 
negative,” Harris said. “F.verytliing was fine except 
when I showed them the wirephoto, a white-haired, 
elderly woman told me, 4 Oh, my, I believe that picture is 
in Washington for a photographers' contest.' 

• "I then went to a short, balding man who seemed 
to Ik in charge of the office. He was curt and abrupt 
and said he didn't know when the picture w*ould he re- 
turned. He pointed to several stacks of pictures and 
said what I wanted could Ik in there but he doubted it 
ForJwcLand a half hours I went through those filcsof 
pictures Ik fore I found a ^clcar, positive copy?'*

Tbrqucli ? newspaper friend 1 1 arris, learned of 
rnar«>s]Ioffmaii, a free-lance photographer with* the 
nitatioiibf Infill^ a fine craftsman, lloffinan looked 
the positive print, remarked it was fair and offered 
sec wliat he could do with it. Shooting through an 
ricatc system of microscopes he produced a lilow- 
hringing into sharp focus the Presidential limousine 
1 the crowd behind. Harris became more convinced 
(ii ever that the quest ion of the man in the doorway 
efviJd to Ik: asked, and answered. 

Harris next sought to solicit pfficial action. He * 
night a1>out Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kcu- 
ty, whom he had met socially. Senator Cooj*cr 
tud Ik? an ideal contact as he was a mem her of the 
arren Commission, appointed hy President Johnson 
conduct a definitive incpiiry into the assassination, 
called Senator Cooper ** Harris said. "He was busy 
n suggested that 1 come to Washington and call his 
ficc and he would come off the Senate floor to see, 
r if he could. I didn’t want to do that. 

“I had known [former Supreme Court Justice] 

I i\ Frankfurter, so 1 called his secretary. I knew 
was sick. She said to put tny information in a 
tier. I didn’t think I should do that" t- 

Early, in February, liar ns told* his story to his 
torncy, ArnolJKKrakowcr, a New York lawyer with . * 
ficcs bn East 5Jtl StrccUKrakowcr, a 4S-y car-old 
arvard Law School graduate with rugged features, 

■ vhlly remembers the day Harris called on him. "The 
uncut I saw the enlargement I became interested. It 
as obvious the public had to be told whether it is or 
not Oswald. If it is Oswald, how can he he upstairs 
ring bullets? I'm not interested in whether Oswald 
as a Communist, a Fascist, or whatever. I'm only in- 
reshaHu who did it This country is' maJi»rc_rnnngh 
lx told the whole truth." 

. • 

The attorney said he had previously 1*ccn puzzled 
y conflicting reports concerning the case. "We seem 
> have been fed a lot of pap alnnit sound police tech- 
nics," Krakower said. "First you read that the gun 
iincd by Oswald when he was captured in the movie 
heater had misfired, that you could see the imprint 
»f the hammer on the cartridge case. Almost at the 
.line time they tell yon another officer had put his 
ingcr between the hammer and the cartridge, pre- 
cnling the bullet from l>cing fired. One of these stories 
ant possibly he true. And there is no explanation why 
rippit, the officer they say Oswald killed, was one and 
i half miles off his beat, or why Tippit sn>pcclcd 
Oswald in the first place. There arc too many blanks us 
;hc case. I t hought alxmi the picture 1 don’t know how 
long.*! decided if Harris had this thing, others diuTbo."

Krakower was dead fighrcrUitii other* having the 
picture,' and w'omkiing al*oii| it. Weeks i*ci«>rV Harris 
came across the picture browsing in lknibh day's, well- 
informed couvers.it ions in New York, Dallas and 
Washington turned on the identity of "the man in the 
doorway" of the Dc|Hjsitory. On !)cctnil»cr 2, in fact, 
only ten days after the assassination, the Ass , »cL*itcd 
Press had circulated to invm1*r ncwspajnTS awl maga- 
zines an enlargement of the picture with a circle drawn 
. around the face in the doorway. "I’hoto arotiws new 
interest," the caption read. "The photo seems to show 
the 'accused assassin larc Harvey Oswald standing at 
ground level behind the motorcade at the entrance to 
the Texas School Kook Depository. . . ." The caption 
went on to say, "Authorities said the man in the picture 
is not Oswald but another employee of the Dejxjsitnry." 

• Despite his avid researches in the AP files, Harris 
had not known of the A P's caption. And even if he 
did, subsequent events .suggest, ii would not have dis- 
couraged Harris from pursuing the matter, lie was 
looking for positive proof, not undetailed assertions. 

Krakower wrote to the Warren Commission and 

( told them he wanted an appointment with J. Lee Kan- 
kin, the commission’s chief counsel— "and not the FKl 
or anylnxJy else." The commission replied and agreed 
to see Krakower and Harris. Expenses were offered 
but declined. On February 24 the two men kept an 11 
a. m. appointment at the commission’s headquarters in 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars building in Washington. ,

tcrs/*Tlicn lie turned to me," Harris said, "and asked 
if I knew Miles Ilirson. I said no, but that I had known 
his brother Roger when w e loth attended Friends Semi- 
nary in New York City." Harris is still baffled as to 
how' Shaffer knew of his long-ago acquaintanceship 
with a schoolmate. 

The two showed Shaffer the blown-up assassin*- * 
tion picture with the mystery figure in the background. 
Shaffer simply asked how Harris had gotten the pic- 
ture and the process used in its enlargement After- 
wards, the three men were called into J. Lee Rankin’s 
office. Per functor)' greetings followed and Rankin 
inspected the picture "He did not say one word while 
we were in there," Krakower said later. "He didn’t 
register a thing." 

he three men returned to the other office and 
Shaffer brought out a huge photograph of the same 
scene. "They obviously had l#ccn studying this from 
every angle," remarked Krakower. “Shaffer said he 
did not know if it was Oswald, but that the commission

The three next had lunch together. 
kbimer telephone numbers where Tic coukl l>c 
riled at liis home aiul at his Justice Department 
\ Warren Commission offices. Shaffer reportedly 
J them to call or write to him at any time and as- 
ed them that he would keep in touch with them, 
irrit and Krakower ’ then returned to New York. 

A few weeks later Harris finally learned that the 
m shown in the doorway had l>ecn reliably identified 
one BjllJS^vclady, a warehouseman at the Rook -j t ' 
povtory who had worked with Oswald. Unknown to 
arH and Krakower, Lovclady had been identified 
the figure in the picture by the FBI the day after 
; assassination/ (This was, apparently, the source for 
d AP wption put out on December 2.) 

This development did not deter Harris and Kra- 
wer "What we want is. conclusive proof that the 
hi is not Oswald, not just the bland assurance it is 
jvdanJy/' Krakower says. ‘There should 1>c a total 
rc&iigation of this facet of the case. The president of 
■c American Bar Association was appointed ‘defense 
uuseF to Ia’c Harvey Oswald by the Warren Com- 
isbiuil. He should he allowed to cross-examine Love- 
ly as if Oswald were alive and on trial and had in- 
Ljduced this picture as evidence in his defense. God, 
hope it isn’t Oswald in the picture. But I want it 
liYhlhhcd beyond any doubt at L* • 

l r or some two weeks after their Washington mcct- 
Shaffer and Krakower continued to communicate ' 

Y mail and telephone. In a letter written early in 
larch, Krakower pointedly referred to an article pub- 
died in Commentary, which raised several provocative 
■ uMioni relative to the assassination and the in- 
evtigMion. He has not since heard from Shaffer or • 
iy other staff member of the commission. 

Because he believes the commission did not act 
t good faith with him, Krakower no longer fccls,l*ound 
> keep his pledge of silence. “In this ease, involving 
: i assassination of the President of the United States, 

; there was any kind of conspiracy and the fact was 
niiccaled and I was in a position to contribute One 
.ii it ilia of evidence and didn’t dc it, l wouldn’t be 
Me to live with myself,*’ he commented. “Where do 
get off bucking the commission? Maybe better minds 
re right. But you always end up saying the truth is 
he truth and no S.O.B. has a right to say it is not 
>swald unless he supplies proof. That’s all we are 
-*Mpg p I pray it. is Lovclady.* # % 

Both Harris and K rakower have taken precau- 
>ns against someone trying to halt their private 
UM'tc Krakower has written letters detailing his in- 
Mvetnent in the case, to be held in escrow against 
tc chance tliat something happens to him. Harris has 
laced a positive print of the assassination scene in 
Manhattan tank vault. He keeps all his photos, cor- # 
«*>jh>ik1ci>cc dealing with the ease, magazine articles 
ad other paraphernalia in a sea-lion skin traveling bag.

just as, his oictjirc was a^P to be snapped. This by- 
play went on for almost three weeks. Bdekmau, how- 
cvcr, was determined to succeed. One Friday as Lovc- 
lady was about to quit work, Beckman stationed him- 
self outside on the sidewalk. He later described the 
episode in a report: “.At 4:40 I saw L. and a blonde 
(20 years) girl, I edged back and waited, camera poised. 
The girl, from around the corner, stampeded up in a 
'rage and slapped my right forearm and began an 
abusive tirade.** The “blonde girl,** as Beckman later 
learned to his surprise, was Lovclady’s wife. Lovclady, 
meanwhile, had called a patrolman who was directing 
traffic and the three were taken to police headquarters. 
They were then transferred to the police surveillance j 
office and after some questioning were released. Reek- I 
man was advised to leave Dallas. 

Lovclady is flatly unwilling, understandably so, 
to have his picture published. As he put it, in a Texas 
drawl heavy enough to chew on, “Sonic crazy S.O.B. 
might take a $bot*at me because I look like Oswald/* 
*IIc docs, in fact, bear a similarity’ to Oswald. He Is 
alxrnt an inch shorter, stockier and his hair, sparse like 
Oswald's, is a bit darker. But an impressionistic camera 
image could minimize these differences. “Hell, I’m 
better lookin’ than he was,** Lovclady enjoys saying. 

Lovclady maintains it is he standing in the door- 
way at the moment of the assassination. “I was stand- 
ing on the first step,** he told me when I interviewed 
him two weeks ago in Dallas. “Several people in the 
picture saw me. That lady shading her eyes works here, 
on the second floor.** 

Lovclady said that the. night following the assas- 
sination two FBI agents visited his home. “They said 
they had a blown-up picture they wanted nic to see. 
Right away I j>o*mtctl to me and they seemed relieved. 
One had a big smile on his face because it wasn’t Os- 
wald. They said they had a big discussion down at 
| the FBI and one guy said it just had to be Oswald. ** 1 

cG ovclady recalled that shortly after the assassina- 
tion when Oswald’s image appeared and reappeared 
on television programs, his two stqjchildrcn, a boy 
six and a girl four, would point to the screen and say, 
“There’s daddy.** lie said that while watching the motor- 
cade from the doorway of the Book Depository he 
distinctly heard three shots — “there was one, then a 
pause and two fast ones.* fn the confusion that fol- 
lowed he said he ran 75 to 100 yards to where the 
Presidential limousine had been, “but, man, they were 
going by that time.** He relumed to the warehouse and 
a roll call was taken of the dozen or so men in his 
work gang. Only Oswald was missing. 

Ijovclady remembers that on the morning of No- 
vember 22, the day of the assassination, he had seen 
Oswald ‘on the sixth floor of the warehouse. “I was 
putting in some flooring and he came over and asked 
al*out some book orders. We had a 10 o’clock break, 
then went back to work until noon, when we knocked 
off for lunch and to see the President** He said be 
could not recall whether Oswald went downstairs with 
the rest of the men because both were working on 
different jobs/And besides, Oswald didn’t ihingle much.

of Oswald -lie was Quiet, carried on no conversa- 
tion. He'd keep to himself mostly. He might read a 
book or a magazine or something but he'd have nothing 
to do with nobody. He'd ask a question about the 
orders, maybe, but that's about all. I can talk to a guy 
a couple of minutes and tell whether I like him. I 
didn't like Oswald/' 

Lovclady is more than a little irked by the atten- 

I tion he has received over the picture that still haunts 
Jones Harris. "The FBI, Secret Service, and the War- 
ren Commission have all questioned me I don't know 
how many times," he remarked. lie remains dead set 
against having his picture taken. "I got a wife and 
three kids to take care of and don't want trouble *>/ 
having my mug in a newspaper " he explains. * 

J. W .j^tpens, veteran AP photographer in Dallas, 

recalls shooting the classic assassination picture io 
great detail. % "I was about. 30 feet in front of the 
President's limousine on Mrs. Kennedy’s side. I rc- 
mcmltcr hearing what I thought was a firecracker at 
the instant I snapped the picture. I was going to make 
another picture, the one I was really set up for, when. 
I realized what had happened and I froze, aghast" 

% days ag6, still brooding over the picture, 
Jones Harris flew to Dallas, met with Lovclady and 
talked with him for about a quarter of an hour. 
Lovclady told him, yes, it was he standing in the 
I f doorway. Ijovclady also told him that the FBI had 
[* taken several pictures of him, presumably to com-- 
pare with the AP picture of the assassination scene.* 
Lovclady also said that on November 22 he was wear- 
ing a red -and -white striped sport slurt buttoned near 
the nock. 

Harris left Dallas still unconvinced. "I admit 
there is a strong resemblance between Lovclady and 
the blow-up of the figure standing in the doorway," 
he said. "But the figure in the picture docs not appear 
to be wearing a striped shirt and it is buttoned very 
low, showing much of his white T-shirt Why doesn’t 
I the Kill or the Warren Commission have Lovclady 
pose in the doorway and have Altgens take a picture 
from the same distance and with the same camera as 
on NovcmlKrr 22?" 

Altgens, one of the very few witnesses who was 
close enough actually to see the President shot, -is 
abje to describe in minute detail what happened at 
that terrible moment Yet, he has never been ques- 
tioned by the FBI or the Warren Commission. 

The Warren Commission is expected to release 
its full report on the assassination of President 
Kennedy in a matter of weeks, perhaps before June 
is out Jones Harris hopes the report will resolve 
all his doubts about the identity of the tnan in the 
doorway. Until then, Harris insists on doubting. 
"It's all very strange," he says. «*. 


{ * The FBI told the Herald Tribune that it had 

turned over to the Warren Commission everything 
it had on the assassination and that it ,<ould.Jiot

Commission had gone off - as scheduled. The street was tied-up from 
6 a.m. to 1 p.m. and there were some traffic problems after 11 a.m. 

He said except for a few odds and ends, the matter has been completed 
and he will be returning to Washington this evening. 

lie said that there is a possibility that Commission members 
Warren, Boggs, Ford and Russell will come down to Dallas next weekend 
to actually see for themselves the scene of the assassination, inasmuch 
as a visit to the actual scene appears to clarify in the minds of 
Commission members questions which have arisen during the study of 
the event. * - •

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT 
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY 
NOVEMBER 22, 1963. DALLAS . TEXAS 


On' May 23, 1964, the Dallas Office of the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation received the following quoted communications from 
Mrs. Mark E. Martin, Hominy, Oklahoma: . » ’ 


"Letter to J. Edgar Hoover 


"Sir: 


"We require an explanation for the distribution of evidence 
in the case of Lee Harvey Oswald. 

"We refer specifically to the photograph (* t ran spar ancles*) 

of a man holding a rifle (?) on the cover of LIFE Magazine, 

February 21, 1964. This photograph was first reported in 

the hands of the Dallas police who removed it from the home 

of Ruth Paine, November 23, 1963. 

• » 

"The Dallas police announced on November 25 *, 1963, that .'all 
evidence in the case (having to do with the assassination)' 
had been turned over to the FBI at the request of that agency. 
This included the photograph. 

"Yet, the FBI (and you, sir) has recently stated that the 
case concerning the assassination 'has not been closed' and 
will not be closed for many years. 

* * • 

"How, then, did this particular piece of incriminating 
evidence fall into the hands of LIFE Magazine? Recent 
newspaper statements say that Marina Oswald, sold this photo-* 
graph to LIFE for $5,000. How was Mrs. Oswald able, as early 
as February, 1964,* to sell a prime piece of the people's 
evidence?

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT

NOVEMBER 22, 1963, DALLAS ^ TEXAS ; 

’’Certainly certain britches or the United States government 
have rot conducted themselves In either a discreet or . 
judiciou3 uix.o.ner in *.hi* regard. (Nor have they done so 
in other instances ot mishandled and concealed evidence.) 

."The point to reoieuher is that a much-loved President has 
been killed. Repeated attempts to pull the wool over the 
eyes of the public would be more successful (as they have 
been in the past) if so much were not at stake. 

"As it Ip, cue agency loses face, a whole nation may, 

too. 

"Sincerely, 

Mrs. Mirk E. Martin and Children 

Hominy, Oklahoma 

5/20/64" 



"Concerning Rowland, Bel in, and the Warren Commission 
(not to mention Allen Dulles.. which is just as well) 


"David Bel in, attorney for the W&rren Commission, emphasizes 
the testimony of a '20-year-old part time college student* 
who told reporters or? November 22, 1963, he saw a man with 
a rifle on the sixth l loor of the Texas Book Building 15 
minutes before the usrassluation. 


"The following is & quote from Rowland as taken from a 
reporter's notebook: 


"*I locked up at the. Tnx&s School Bock Depository 
Building end noticed that the second floor from 
the top had two adjoining windows open, and on 
looking up I saw what looked like a man ABOUT 15 
FEET BACK FROM THE WINDOW and he appeared to be 
holding a HIGH POWERED MFIE W1IH A SCOPE. He 
appeared to be holding the rifle at parade rest. 
I mentioned to toy wife at the tims--Look, honey, 
they've got secret service, men everywhere.*

"Mr. Rowland's statement Is extraordinary. As is his 
eyesight. No need to discuss here what a defense attorney 
would do In court to a witness such as this. The tragedy 
^•lies in the seeming excited credence given such witnesses 
by the Warren Commission. 

- "To add to the total absurdity is the statement made by 
Allen Dulles during bis recent, brief 'investigative' 
trip to Dallas.

ASSASSINATION OP PRESIDENT 
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY 

RE: Anonymous Letters Alleging 

Cover-up In Assassination 


By letter dated May 23, 1964/ Mr. R oX H . ] ROECKER, 
Manager, Baltimore Office, Pinkerton's National Detective 
Agency, Incorporated, 509 One Charles Center, Baltimore 1, 
Maryland, forwarded to the Baltimore Office of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) two handwritten, anonymous letters, 
which had been postmarked at Baltimore and received by his 
office, Mr, ROECKER explained that four such “crank" letters 
had been received, beginning approximately three weeks pre- 
viously, but that they had been destroyed by clerical personnel 
in his office. He understood that past letters had referred 
to the assassination of the late President KENNEDY, and indicated 
that investigations of the assassination had been covered up. 

In addition, the letters had claimed that FBI Director, J. EDGAR 
HOOVER, was an advocate of communism and, therefore, responsi- 
ble for the President's assassination. Mr. ROECKER had no 
information concerning the identity of the letter writer. 

The texts of the letters, which are partially illeg- 
ible, are as follows: 

"May 20, 1963 

"The use of the Sheraton Belvedere Hotel by 
Freemasons is ruse for extensive coverup operations, 
while the insane or Pschyo, and his many rabid 
Pschvo’s continue there undercover voilence on homes, 
ancT all-over, the same as before there murder of 
President KENNEDDY , the Policeman ancT OSWALD." 

' ' "May 12, 1962 

"Article F.B.I. (HOOVER) coverup, article how 
F.B.I. protected, coverup. There is a (deadly shade) 
thats power covered. The hidden old insane 
Pschyo Plate continues his rabid insane force on

homes and m bio vicinity. Dob .... used by him , 

to promote rabid force. This deadly shade power is 
all over ’coi.viiittr-.ng rabid insane harm. This done 
before (as now) his/tbere/ RUBYS) murder of Presi- 
dent KE NNEDDY , the Policeman, OSWALD. They might 
reworlT' the OSdALD case again, same as they have done 
before manovering statements that they twist, all 
of the same extensive coverup.” 

On May 26, 1^64, the Baltimore Office of the FBI 
received by mail from the William J. Burns Detective Agency^ 

1&00 North Charles Street, Baltimore, Maryland, handwritten 
copxe~ of foregoing letters which had been similarly mailed 
anonymously to the Burns Agency. 

'• The Burns Agency had no information concerning 
the identity of the letter -writer.

f » .J ••• 





David Belin, attorney for the Varrcn Commission, emphasizes the *' “ 
testimony of a "20-year-old part time college student" who told, 
reporters on November 22, 19&3» he saw a man with a rifle on the ’ 
sixth floor of the Texas Book Building 15 minutes before the > . 

assassination* - r*, ' .. 

The following i6 a quote from Rowland C6 tiikcn from a reporter* s 
notebook: . , 

"I looked up at the Texas School Book Depository Building and noticed 
that the second floor from the top had two adjoining windows open, . 
and on looking up I saw vhat looked like a man ABOUT 15 FEET BACK 
FROM THE WINDOW and he appeared to be holding a HIGH POWERED RIFLE . 
WITH A SCOPE. He appeared to be holding the rifle at parade rest* 

I mentioned to my wife at the time— Look, honey, they*vo got 
secret service men everywhere*" 

Mr* Rowland’s statement io extraordinary. Ac is his eyesight. No 
need to discuss here what a defence attorney vould do in court to 
a witness such as thi6* The tragedy H03 in the seeming excited 
credence given such witnesses by the Warren Commission* . s , 

■* * , m i \ * . * 

To add to the total absurdity is the statement made by Allen Dulles I 
during his recent, brief "investigative" trip to Dallas. / 

**Ve didn't discover anything now," Mr, Dulles said. 

We didn't really expect him to, did wo?

This is the 13th letter to the Commission on Martin, 

.The above SAC letter alerted the field to her continuing campaign 
of ‘vilification of the Director and the FBI, Since the assassi- 
nation Martin has been conducting her own investigation and she 
has been described as a "bright nut." : 

The letter dated 5-20-64 relates to the photograph of 
Oswald carrying a rifle and wearing a revolver which appeared in 
"Life" Magazine. Martin relates allegedly all evidence was turned 
over to the FBI and implies that "certain branches of the United 
States . Government" have "mishandled and concealed evidence," She 
is off 'base again as it has been previously determined^ copies » 
of this photograph were produced in large quantities by the Dallas 
Police Department and no effective controls were enforced. An 1 

official of Life has advised us that the copy obtained by them was 
obtained from an "enterprising young police officer," from the 
Dallas Police Department. * 

The 5-21-64 letter sets out an alleged newspaper release 
made by David Belin of the Commission wherein it is reported an 
individual had seen a man with a rifle on the sixth floor of the > | 

Texas School Book Depository Building (TSBDB) fifteen minutes i 

before the assassination, and at this time the man was standing 
about fifteen feet back of the window. This individual was believed 
by the witness to be a Secret Service man. Martin alleges undue 
credence has been given to this witness’s statement and also she 
is critical of the statement made by Allen Dulles of the Commission 
wherein he is reported to have stated after his inspection trip to 
Dallas that nothing new was discovered. Martin is apparently 2 

referring to Arnold Louis Rowland, a 19 year old high school E 

student, who was interviewed by our Dallas Office on 11-22-63. J£ 

The facts as reported by Martin are substantially correct as far 
as his statements are concerned) -of course, there were other 
witnesses who observed an individual in the window. All interviews 

of witnesses have been furnished to the Commission, and there is « 

no information available to us which would indicate the Commission 
is lending any undue credence to this one statement by Rowland. ^ 

The 5-22-64 letter is short and is set out in a question- 
answer format allegedly after a conversation by Martin with Roy S. 
Truly, warehouse superintendent of the TSBDB, and concerns the 
photograph taken by an Associated Press photographer of the 
Presidential Motorcade just as President Kennedy was shot, at which 
time an individual was observed in the doorway of the TSBDB who 
resembled Oswald. This individual has been positively identified as 
Billy Nolan Lovelady, employee of the TSBDB. Martin endeavors In 
her letter to show that Lovelady and Oswald according to Truly, do 
not really look ali£a,and the implication is that somebody is covering

The anonymous letter relates that the writer, while 
in a restaurant near the Mexican border, overheard a conversa- 
tion between two individuals in the Spanish language. According 
to the writer, the conversation concerned politics and turned 
to the assassination of President Kennedy. One of the unidenti-

that other identified third parties were responsible for the 
assassination of President Kennedy, and that Chief Justice 
Bari Warren was the next logical one to be "eliminated.” , 2 -

A summary of the tape enclosed pith this letter is 
as follows: 


Ihe tape begins by WALTON giving his name as PRES7LEY 
J. WALTON, 3207 S.W. 15 Avenue; Fort Lauderdale, Florida,* 
the date as 2/20/64, and Is addressed to {Resident JOHNSON* .. 

In the ta po, WALTON says: . > ',*■* ‘ ... 5 . 

Regarding the threats to the life of the President 
on hlB visit to Miami, Florida, on 2/28/64, he does not pant . * 
to shako him or be abusive, but bas to ytake the points for. v* r - ; 
his protection as he would like to have been able to do tor i. 
the late President KENNEDY, Be pants to give some cold facts 
on this matter loading to the assassination of President - 
KENNEDY. The people who wore responsible for this are friends 
of President JOHNSON, as well as his, "On the surface," be, 
WALTON, Is a "cranlc and a crackpot," running around living In 
every neighborhood and environment thAt would not be considered 
a decent place for a reputable citlseen to live. Be lives 
In poverty and does not make enouch to pay Income taxes, but 
can turn up three million very quickly, probably quicker than 
the President can, and the money will be three million bonost 
dollars* ~

EISENHOWER von the election, as the starting point had 
©ante to tell about some people wbo he (presumably the , 

President) will screaa about and defend, but they are the '.V 
people who are staking threats against him. (The "him* 1 referred 
to is not definitely clear). This can be checked with Senator . 
JOHN COOPER and began with the murder of Judge CHANNELSWORTH 
(phonetic) and his wife, WALTON claims to have been an eye ?• 
witness to the death of a lira, BEN LENEER (phonetic) and knows 
why she died. WALTON was In the employment of the Fairchild S> 
Funeral Home and took Mr, LENEER' s place when he left to gO’M*^ 
into business for himself. He accuses the people who work ' v 
with President JOHNSON as being murderers, but admits he ;r : - 
cannot provo It, and he is sure that they were the same 
people who killed President KENNEDY. WALTON says they will ' 
kill him because "he has seen them kill," Be names BEN 
TAYLOR, the City Auditor In Miami, and a man by the name of 
BILL CRAIGCRAFT, or HUTCHCRAFT, a State Auditor, and indicates ; 
: that the latter probably works for President JOHNSON,'.-.* ^^tyct 

WALTON then goes back to relate items concerning* *' * •/: 
BEN TAYLOR on the missing persons list and states that while 
the police were looking for him, TAYLOR was at BEN LENEER's 
funeral home, WALTON continuos with disjointed items concerning 
a tape recorder and othor equipment slipped Into the funeral 
home and the fact that hie wife was a fingerprint expert and 
photographer for Cuba, . > . . -

He then goes back to mention tbe CHANNELSWORTH case - V

He mentions a suspicious white Cadillac which he was 
told was to be given to President EISENHOWER when he came to ' 
Miami, Slnco President EISENHOWER refused to use the car, Mr, 
LENEER took over the car, 

WALTON then relates a disjointed series of items 
concerning someone coming Into the dormitory where he slept 
at the funeral home, whom he subsequently identified as BEN 
TAYLOR, He accused TAYLOR of sleeping In a casket in tbe ' 
display room. He then gives a disjointed account of how 
former President JOHN F, KENNEDY comes into the case as S'-

"r about. The investigation of the FBI began immediately after ' r - 

"Mr, LONG" was kidnapped and run into Texas to be held In a > .. 
rK:u' mental institution without legal recourse. Checks and balances 
-let -\? J j ••• are needed between the CIA and the FBI, There are lots of 
i vv good criminology students available and they have to remove 
• r Mr, HOOVER to modify the system; ' Mr, HOOVER did not use ' 

-V * road blocks in the Wllmore bank robbery and they should have 

been used. The State airplane was not used and he, WALTON, 
was not notified that a bank robbery occurred. The robbers 
were finally caught by two Quaker preachers and because Mr, 
HOOVER did not charge the robbers with the bank robbery 
f offense, he, WALTON, is ashamed of his home town, ; v;r- ^ . 


<■: 


vV'v. * He gives disjointed accounts about his displeasure - / 
about the Issuance of license plates in Tallahassee, Florida,' 
and ties this in with the fact that thoro is no office of • — . 
narcotics agents in Louisville, Kentucky, which io the dlreot*. 
..fault of Mr, HOOVER, He then mentions a court case being s./ 
prepared to get Mr, HOOVER's resignation, which will be 
handled by men trained in criminology and law. This is also 
mentioned along with the fact that there is a good jail In 
Fayette County, but they do not want to pay for federal 
prisoners to be kept there, "They" are not further identified, 

WALTON then maligns Attorney General KENNEDY for 
having spont four years trying to get JIMMY HOFFA and finally • 
winning a jury tampering case and not realizing ho won it, fie 
says bo would havo liked to have soon KENNEDY mako the grade 
as an attorney, since he likes the KENNEDY boys, and had /jv • 

. promised the late JOI1N F, v KENNEDY that he would make an 
„■ attorney out of HOBBY KENNEDY, but .be can see no hope for 
• him now,"" N";'

^RESIDENT’S COMMISSION 

Assassination of the iresident 


M alley 

MmJL 




Today while discussing other matters with Mr. «T. Lee Rankin of the 
resident’s Commission, Mr. Rankin advised that the Chie: Justice has indicated ' - 
would like to go to Dallas Sunday, June7, 1964, and make a personal inspection 
the various sites in Dallas relating to the assassination of Iresident Kennedy. 

|h. Rankin indicated he would accompany the Chief Justice and that Congressman ; 
ord would possibly be 1:. .he Dallas area making a speech over tbs week end and • 
ight join the Chief Justice in Dallas. Mr. Rankin did not know at the time he talked 
b Malley whether Congressman Boggs would or would not make this trip. He stated 
hat Secret Service was making the necessary arrangements for this trip and that it r 
■as planned that the group would leave on a military plane, probably at 6:00 a.m.'~ • • 
nday morning and make the inspection as rapidly as possible and return to Wash- 
ington the same day. Mr. Rankin asked Malley whether or no: he would like to make 
histrip. * ' 

Mr. Rankin was advised that if the Commission desiied Malley to * . 

| accompany the group that he was ready and available to go at any time. Mr. Rankin 
stated that it was up to Malley whether he wanted to go. Malley repeated that he 
was most desirous of cooperating with the Commission fully and it was not a question 
of whether he desired to go but whether the Commission wanted him to go. At this 
time Mr. Rankin stated that he saw no real necessity for Malley making this trip inas 
much as it was to be merely an inspection so that the Chief Justice could familiarize 
himself with the surround-vgs in Dallas, 

~ ‘ ‘ - * ** .** * 

Mr. Rankin was again advised that Malley was completely agreeable to “ 
making the trip if the Commission desired it and he would be available on short

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT 
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, 

NOVEMBER 22. 1963 DALLAS . TEXAS . , 

On May 18, 1964, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
at Washington, D. C., received the following quoted anonymous 
letter loan envelope on : >hldh the postmark was illegible: r ;. 


, iV vj dt. ^ 


"Federal Bureau of Investigation 
"Washington, D. C. 

"Gentlemen: 


"A While back I pverheard the most unusual conversation 
in a restaurant near the Mexican Border. It has 
bothered me ever since, so am going to give it to you 
as best as can be remembered. 

"These two men were sitting in a booth next to myself, 
l^^and they were talking Spanish. As so many bilingual -/ 

people seem to take for granted that as you are a ".y.-:- - 

blue-eyed gringo you can't understand the language, ■ 

and they talk as if you did not exist. Now I do not ’’ ■ 

believe that the one man Who was doing the talking of ‘ • 

which I speak, was a Mexican — he may have been part Vy’-* 
Mexican,. tho, as he did speak with an accent to the 
cashier in English. Would say he is about 5*6" tall, 
rather small, tho with a little paunch, and would... . A , 

ix^weigh about 145 to 150 ^TT) Brown eyes, grey curley - ■ 

^x^hair, of wa^ve^ , a dark complexion , small hands for a 
maij . Re was*” the driver of a 1954 or 1955 Packard, 
j^^4dpor sedan, Arizona license number EZY 958. Oh 

a rather long, grey mustache, about 50 to 55 ' . ..* 

yrs. old.

"From the conversation would gather that he 
resides In either Tucson, or some place not 
very far from the Mexican border below Tijuana 
or Mexicali, and also must have many friends 
in San Diego. 



"Now for the conversation. They were talking 
politics and the Kennedy asslnatlon came up. 
This man stated that he and a companion were v 
on the outskirts of Dallas vftien they heard the 
news on the car radio. The companion wanted 
to go on Into Dallas and see vfoat was going on, 
but this man said he told him no that he didn't 
dare, as he knew that 'they had finally done 
It', and he didn't want to take a chance of 
seeing anyone vfoo might connect him with the 
affair. He said that he knew months before 
that Kennedy 'had to die', that there was no 
other way for 'It' to be handled, and he knew 
that 'they' (vhoever the heck they may be) was 
on the verge of taking action In Dallas, as It . 
would be an Ideal place. 



"If he knows vho 'they' may be, then I think - 

you should know also. He was so damnebly smug • • *-v 

about the vtfiole thing vfoen he was talking. He " — 

also stated that during WWII he had top security 

clearance, so now he goes most places and vfoen he * l 

shows his Identification, then he Isn't questioned, v.- ' 

He stated that he keeps Mexican citizenship so that , \ 

he can go back and forth without question. (This 
sounds slightly crazy to me, as I don't know any- 
thing about such, but didn't know that you could 
maintain Mexican citizenship and American at the ' 
same time.) Perhaps he was born American, and 
took out Mexican citizenship.

"To top this off , he asks the other nan Who 
lie thinks will be the next on the Hat. Be 
stated that there were many of course, thorn 
i/they* would like to eliminate, but Earl 
^Warren was given top priority. Ye Gads! What 
a character! Even if he is just a 'nut* of 
some sort, such .talk isn't exactly calming 
dinner conversation.

"I haven't the faintest idea if Earl Warren 
has plans of visiting San Diego, or if he had 
residence there at one time, but would gather 
that he may have from the conversation. Who- 
ever 'they' are, must have ideas that somevhere 
in California would be a likely place to set up 
something for Mr. Warren vfoich would be as un- 
healthy as What Mr. Kennedy experienced. 


"Now you must have hundreds of clues to run dovm 
on the Kennedy assination, and I wouldn't want 
to be a pest, cr a nut, but that conversation 
has bothered me, and you can take it as you see 
fit. If the man is Just a blabber-mouth, then 
ho may know nothing. If he is just egotistical 
enough to 'have to talk to someone about how 
much he knows' in order to impress someone, 
then ho just may know something. You are the 
Judge of that. 

"Anyhow it's off my mind now, and I would like 
to forgot it, although as you know better than 
anyone, these things must keep cropping up. The 
Intricate network of politics, different groups, 
communistic and otherwise, must keep you people 
jt arcing your hair to protect people in public 
[office.

Dear Mr. Hoover: ' 

„ An article by Richard K. Doan in the May 7, fit 

19o^ edition of the New York Herald Tribune reported | 
that NBC plans to do a‘ "White Paper" on the assassina- I 
tion late this year or early next year. The article 
went on to say that the Executive ^Producer of the |JA 
"White Paper,” Irving Gltlln, "was reluctant to discuss! ] 
whether any heretofore unseen film of the Dallas 
tragedy had been uncovered. . 'A major film search has J\ 
been made,' he said, 'but I'd rather not discuss that 
at this point. 1 ” 

Could you please determine whether NBC has • 
discovered any new film relating to the assassination. v 


Sincerely, 


J 1

May 7, 1964, issue of the "New York Herald Tribune” in an article written by O ^

and "he elaborated" considerably to dramatize the forthcoming production. Mr. WogaA , 
I said actually what Gitlin is talking about is some film of interviews conducted by NBC 9 *

Dear Mr. Rankin: S * ^

Reference is made to the conversation bad with 
you on June 1, 1964, by Mr. James R. Malley concerning the 
retention of the cameras of Orville Nix and Marie Muchmore, 
as well as the Bell and Howell camera owned by Abraham 
Zapruder and subsequently turned over to the Bell and Howell 
Company in Chicago, Illinois. * 

In accordance with this conversation. Inasmuch 
as the President's Commission has no further need for these 
cameras, arrangements are being made for these cameras to 
be returned to their owners as soon as possible.

Federal Bureau dw^inreeUg&tlon 

Washington, D. C. : * • ’ ' '■ 

Gentlemen: • • -.l ./••••. - 

A while back I overheard the most unusual conversation In a 
. restaurant near the Mexican Border. It has bothered me ever > 
since, so an going to give it to you as best as can be remen- 
/ Jbered.‘.> ^ 




.These two nen were sitting in a booth next to nyeelf, and ^ 

’* they were talking Spanish. As so many bl-llngual people " .'y~L' v: ' 

seem to take for granted that as you are a blue-eyod gringo ‘ 
you can't understand the language, and they talk as if you . 

did not exist. Now I do not believe that the one man who was - ri . 
doing the talking of which I speak, was a Mexican— he nay have 
V /been part Mexican tho, as he did speak with an accent to the * 

. j, cashier in English. Would say he is about 5* 6" tall, rather 

' *v small, tho with a little paunch, and would weigh about 145 to ^ , 

^v'- 150 lb.- Brown eyes, grey curley hair, or wavey, a dark 

J7"* . • complexion, small hands for a man.- He was the driver of a -fy 

/ . ' ^ . 1954 or 1955 Packard. 4 door sedan, Arizona license number _ 

‘ EZY 958* Oh yes, a rather long, grey mustache, /j mi About 50 to 55 yrs. 

->* * * * old. 

% » , From the conversation would gather that he resides in either , 

Tucson, or some place not very far from the Mexican border .- 5 - ^ 
ifi • below Tijuana or Mexicali, . and also must have many friends In “C!f; v : : \ 

. San D lego.- . -r ; j ' . ■ : y. . . 

. - Now for the conversation. They were talking politics and the 

. Kennedy asBination came up. This man stated that he and a . • , 

i oompanion were on the outskirts of Balias when they hoard the. V . 

j,-.K news on the car radfto. The oompanion wanted to go on into •"*. 1 

V. Balias and see what was going on, *but this man said he told him • 

no that he didn't dare, as he knew that "they had finally done v 

.»■>*" It" and ho didn't want to take a ohance of seeing anyone who 

-/I ' •. might connect him with the affair. He said that he knew months 

• . before that Kennedy "had to die" that there was no other way ■ 

for "it" to be handled, and he knew that "they" (whoever the : - ^ 

4 I...,; heck tjicY may be) was on the verge of taking action in Balias, - ; - • 

i-'.'i; as it would be an ideal place. ... 

* ■ - • • ' -• •• . _■■■ 

If he knows who "they" may be, then I think you should know 
, also. He was so damnebly smug about the whole thing when he 
was talking. He also stated that during Wfll he hod top 
security clearance, so now he goes most places and when he 
shows his identification, then ho isn't questioned. He stated ' 
that he keeps Mexican oltlzonship so that he can go back and 
forth without question. (This sounds slightly orazy, to oe, as 
I don't know anything about such, but didn't know that you could 
maintain Mexican citizenship and Amerioan at the same time.) „ 

Perhaps he was born Amerioan, and took out Mexican citizenship. “ 

y To top this off, he asks tho other man who he thinks will be "1*^ 

the next on the list. He statod that there were many of courso, rw-v 
•; • ’ -♦ whom. "they" would like to eliminate, but Earl Warren was given 

V ' V ^ « ’.'J'r- # ; *•> * . ••• 






top priority. Ye Oads! what a characterl Even If he Is Just 
a "nut" of some sort, such talk isn't exactly calming dinner •- 
conversation. ' 

. . -r 

X haven t the faintest Idea if Earl Varren has plans of visiting 
Snn Diego, or If he had residence there at one time, but would 
gathor that ho may have from the conversation. Whoever "they" 
are, must have Ideas that somewhere In California would be a 
likely place to set up something for Hr. Warren which would 
bo as unhealthy as what Mr. Kennedy experienced. 


Now you must have hundreds of clues to run down on the Kennedy - 

asslnatlon, and 1 wouldn't want to be a pest, or a nut, but 

that conversation has bothered me, and you can take It as you 

oeo fit. If the man Is Just a blabber-mouth, then he may 

know nothing. If ho Is Just egotistical enough to "have 

talk to someone about how much he knows" in order to impress .^7^. - 

someone, then xhx he Just may know something. You are the.,. 

Judge of that. _ -'T 

Anyhow it's off my mind now, and I would like to forget it, *7 
although as you know bettor than anyone, these things must 
— keep- cropplng-up. Tho intricate network of politics, different 
groups, communistic and otherwise, must keep you people tarolng 
your hair to protoct people in public office. 

Sincerely, •••. 

A Citizen

Michaud was addressed to the Attorney General and was furnished 
to the Bureau through the Bureau of Prisons. lie said in his J. 
opinion he has certain information "plus evidence" with which he 
might be able to "enlighten the Investigation on the assassins-, 
tlon of John Kennedy before the Earl Warren Commission, only."' 
Ho alleged there is’ a plot to assassinate President L. B, :.r.- 
Johnson in the near future. Ho claimed ho was placed in the 
U. S. Medical Center as a result of a well-planned frame-up in 
connection with his conviction on n threat against President L. B. 
Johnson. He considered all this a plan to discredit him and 
"salt me away," ne asked the Attorney General to act for the - 
protection of the President and for a reply to his letter as - 
to the Attorney General's actions.

1 !'* • 


To advise you of some interesting details Included in The / ( 

Dallas Police. Department personnel file of officer J. D/*Tippit, who* - 
was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald on 11/22/63. 


BACKGROUND: . , . 

The President's Commission, by letter 5/12/64, requested we 
conduct a limited background investigation of Tippit. and to obtain a 
copy of his personnel file from the Dallas Police Department. Our 
background investigation has failed to show any connection between 
Tippit and Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby. Tippit was born 0/18/24 In 
Texas, served in the Paratroopers during World War II, and entered on i 
duty with the Dallas Police Department on 7/28/52. </ 

/> 

PERSONAL EVALUATION : 


A psychiatric report dated 11/17/52 characterizes Tippit 
as "wholly devoid of imaginative facilities." It indicated his Interests 
and achievements were limited and that his mental functioning and 
thinking corresponded with the community at large. His grip on :'-'V 
reality was below average and it was noted that errors of Judgment 
could be expected. Generally, Tippit was found to be a family nan, 
friendly, dedicated to his children, profession, and his associations ' 
wore limited to fellow officers. There was no indication he led a y V y 
"fast" life. JiW

INJURIES SUSTAINED: 




. 4 ^ During Tippit's career as a police officer he received'/^ 

several alnor Injuries which Included a dog bite In 1957 and a V ' ‘ 

2?'; laceration fron a prisoner In January , 1956. His Dost serious Injury 
' • was during April, 1956, when he was stabbed in the abdomen and knee 

*"j by a Dentally deranged person. It was later found that part of the 

Ice pick was embedded In his kneecap which required surgery to remove. 

* i; Because of this injury he had considerable difficulty with his knee 
1 | from then on. . . • 

t COMPLAINTS: * . ~ 

ijj While a police officer, Tlpplt was charged with failure to ' 

.1 respond to three radio dispatches all of a minor nature. He was -~ 
criticized by a citizen for discourtesy after Issuing a traffic 
summons; however Investigation of this charge indicated the citizen was 
'i disgruntled and probably lied. Tlpplt also failed to appear at 

scheduled court appearances on throe occasions which resulted In a one 
f day suspension without pay on his second dereliction. 

V COMMEN DA TION: . • ' 

♦ 1 — — ■ m — — — imam — 

f ' . i 

Tlpplt was commended for aiding an accident victim, 
recovering stolen property, and was the recipient of three letters of 
; commendation for courtesy as the result of letters sent to the Dallas 
; Police Department by Individuals to whom Tlpplt had Issued traffic tickets 

{ He was the recipient of a "superior award" based primarily on an Incident 

\ which happened on 9/2/56. Tlpplt and his partner received a call for 
f a routine Investigation at a bar where a white Intoxicated male was 

present. When asked to loave this Dan attempted to shoot Tlpplt In the 
I head; however, the gun did not fire. Tlpplt and his partner drew their 
7 service revolvers and killed the Individual who was later Identified ; 

-i as Leonard Garland "who was wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
| for an offense he committed In another state." 

i ' ‘ ' >4 '- *-* ■' - ' ' 

\ Buf lie 26-221633 does not completely substantiate the above 

i observation, however, It Is pointed out that one Leonard Garland was 

being sought as a suspect In an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor 
Vehicle case In which Los Angeles was office of origin In 1957. A 
closing report submitted In this matter states our Dallas office advised 
that Ganland was shot and killed In Dallas on 9/2/56, and that Tlpplt 
■ was one of the officers Involved.

/ 




On the afternoon of June 2, 1064, Mr. Ualley and I / 

discussed the Director's testimony before the President's Commission . 
with Ur. Rankin. You will recall we went over the transcript and 
clarified some 'typographical errors, etc., and ^hereafter left a 
copy with Ur. Rankin. 

Ur. Rankin had only three points which he felt required 
further attention: 

1. Page 6514. In connection with the Director's testimony 
on persons connected with front organizations, the Director stated 
that merely because a man belongs to a subversive organization ~ 
docs not mean he is bLack-listed and is a menace to his country for 
life. If he belongs to 20 of them, it shows he is either very 
gullible, or dumb or he is a menace. "That has been my attitude in 
regard to Government service where you find a Government employed 
who belonged to one or two, maybe in his early days. I think. then 
there is a grave doubt as to whether he is a security risk." 


v 


Ur. Rankin felt this could be clarified to make the point } 

the Director Intended. Ho suggested possibly this be revised to^£2-^- , 


read: "That has been my attitude in regard to Government service 

where you find a Government employee who belonged to one or two, 
maybe in his early days; I don't believe this makes him a security 
risk." Mr. Rankin made it clear, however, that he was not trying;, 
to put words in the Director's mouth; that this testimony would be 
made public and consequently it should state jus.t what the Director 
means it to state. 1 J * /Wy 

To avoid questions from the publif^^^ppge^f^he following 
wording would be preferable; "That has ueon my altitude in regard 
to Govornnont service where you find a Governm ent emplo yee who 
belonged to ono or two, maybe in his oarly days. I don't believe 
this necessarily makes him a security risk. Rather, this would be 
dependent on the dogree of his activity in the front group and his 
purpopo and intent in associatin^iiuself with it.." .»•

2. Page 6544. Ur. Rankin noted that at the beginning of • 

the testimony (Pace 6493) the Chief Justice outlines the areas In ; 
which the Director will be asked to testify. One of them is the-' 
failure to include the name and information concerning Special Agent 
Hosty in the initial report of the Oswald address book. However, ... 
Hr. Rankin never got around to asking the Director about this 
during thq testimony. Ur. Rankin thought we should Include the 
Director's comment on page 6544, where the Director is discussing 
the fact that Hosty's name, office telephone number and license • . . ' 
number were in Oswald's memorandum book. . . . ; - n - 

T7e suggest that the following be Inserted as a paragraph 
after the second line on page 6545: "Incidentally, those items XX'i.' 

'in Oswald's notebook requiring investigative attention were first ' 
set out in an investigative report of our Dallas Office dated 
December 23, 19G3. This report was not prepared for this ” * - 
Commission but rather for investigative purposes and, therefore, , 
the information concerning Hosty's name,' telephone number and _ . ' • 

license number was not included in the report. This information 
| was reported in another investigative report of our Dallas Office 
[dated February 11, 1904, in order that there would be a complete 
reporting of all items in Oswald's memorandum book. Both of these 
^investigativo reports were furnished to this Commission." , 5 

3. Pago 6563 to 6571. Mr. Rankin agreed with the changes 
we had mado in the testimony concerning wording in our appropriation 
bill relative to a provision for the protection of the President* - 
Hov/ever, Hr. Rankin noted that on page 6570 we had eliminated one , 
brief question by Representative Ford and the Director's answer 

as not being pertinent. He agreed with this. He did say he would 
go over this with Representative Ford to make sure Mr. Ford also 
agreed, although he had no doubt that Ur. Ford would be in agreement. 

Ur. Rankin again stressed that the testimony of witnesses 
before the Commission will be mado public and both the Director's 
and Belmont's testimony will be rogarded as policy statements of 
the Bureau. He said that ho had no questions as to the policy - 
enunciated in the testimony and as a matter of fact he felt that 
the testimony would do the Bureau a great deal of good in the eyes 
of the public because it presented the Bureau's sensitivity tc ; ^ . .. 
the rights of the individual and to the necessity of operating : c 
strictly within the law, which was an area of Bureau policy that

had not previously been publicized. He reiterated that thi« 

testinony presented the Bureau in a light that would be new to many 
persons. * . ' 

. ■ • • '-*» - 
I told Ur. Rankin that the Bureau followed the policy that our 
actions spoke louder than our words. - .... 

Ur., Rankin said that he thought the Director was opposed to 
the FBI taking over the functions of Secret Service. I told him 
that this was correct, that the FBI had enough to do without taking 
over such responsibilities. Rankin said that some of the members 
of the Commission 1 ' were of the opinion that Secret Service should be 
transferred over to the FBI and, as a matter of fact, he had noticed 
publicity to tho effect that once the elections were over in 
November, the White House intends to transfer the functions of Secret 
Service to the FBI. I reiterated that I was sure that the Director 
would be opposed to such a move and I asked Rankin whether he had 
any solid basis beyond newspaper publicity that the White House 
Intended such a move. He said he did not have but that he knew the 
respect with which the President regarded the Director and he 
thought it was probably the basis for the newspaper comments, although 
he had no facts on which to base his opinion. 


If you agree, we will make the above changes in the testimony 
and furnish them to Ur. Rankin informally. 



; .*• • r. . , 

2. It is suggested that Hr. Detoach be alert to Insure that 
the views of the Bureau on any possible transfer -of Secret Service -y 
functions to the FBI are known in proper quarters.

With 
a Life 


of Its Own 

by'Dom Bonafcdc* 

. # — • .. 

One day last wintyJmiyxJIg rrii , 4!,-* aKxd into’ 
the Doubkday Book Sm>p on Fifth Avenue between 
56lh nn<l 57 th Streets. He picked up one book after, 
another, each time flipping the pages in a somewhat' 
disinterested manner. Time was not of the essence to 
Jones Harris. A member of a prominent theatrical fare-, 
fly (his mother \% .actress Ruth Cordon and his 
father Jed Harris), and an occasional theatrical 
producer in his own right (Do He Mi, Ditty Coot Eddy), 
he has ample means. During his meandering in Double* 
day 9 * Harris came across a special magazine issue 
titled in black letters, Four Dark Days in History — $1 
Collector's Copy — A Photographic History of President 
Kennedy's Assassination . \ 

Harris, who had met John F. Kennedy on a couple 
of occasions, thoughtfully leafed through the pages. 1 
There are photographs of the smiling, handsome Pres- 
ident and his wife, the cheering crowds, the hand- 
shakes. Then, rather abruptly the fallen President is 
shown photographed through the limousinc*s windshield. 
Ilis left arm is raised to his throat and hflTTTCginning 
iq/urc^ward/riic^. <) U , N , vifc 

reaching -cm to him. To the left of the President Tnir- 
ernor John Connally is slumping over onto his side, lie, 
too, has been hit. Two Secret Service agents on tfic 
limousine behind have already swung at/out to arc 
where the shots originated. The faces of the crowd, 
unaware of what is happening before their eyes, arc 
fixed with finite*. 

Suddenly, Harris* attention was drawn to one of 
the spectators far in the distant background, standing 
in the doorway of the Texas School Book Depository. 
The blurred face, to Harris, seemed to I/e mocking him. 
It couldn't I/e. But there it was: the high forehead, deep- 
set eyes, tapering jaw line, even the set of the mouth. 
The resemblance to I.cc Ilaney Oswald was incred- 
ible, And if the man in the doorway seas Of w aid, svlio, 
then, bad fired the bullets which killed the President? 

Harris paid for the magazine xml went home. For 
days iiiLdi d n othing. It Was January; a1mo>t two full 
mouths had passed since the assassination. V ri iu w as lie

ffkc and he would come off the Senate floor to ace 
if he could. I didn’t want to do that 
"I bad known [former Supreme Court Justice) 
r <U* Frankfurter, so I called his secretary. 1 knew '

Early in FHeuary, Harris lokThis story hi bis 
attorney, A rnohl^KV^.owxr, a New York lawyer with 
offkfi on East $Jd Street. - KruTower, a *48*y ear-old 
Harvard Law Seined graduate with r lifted features, 
thktty remembers the day Harris called on him. *Thc 
moment I saw the enlargement I lac nine interested. It 
was obvious the public had to he told whether it is or 
is not Oswald. If it is Oswald, how can he he upstairs

was a Comimmkt. a Fascist, or whatever. I’m only in- 
|i rcstr n in wh o did it. This country is imiU!£C-tUUMgh 
to lie told the whole truth." 

Tlic attorney said he had previously hern puzzled 
by conflicting reports concerning the case. "We seem 
to )iav* hceif fed a lot of pap aMiul sound |*dice tech- 
niques,” Krakower said. "First yon read that the gun 
aimed by Oswald when he was captured hi the movie 
theater had misfired, that you could. see the imprint 
«if the hammer on the cartridge ease. Almost at the 
same lime they tell you another officer had put his 
finger between the hammer and the cartridge, pre- 
venting the bullet from being find. One of these stories 
can’t possibly lie true. And tin re Is no explanation why

Krakower wrote to the Warren Commission and 

I told them he wanted sn aiqKiintmcnt with J. Lee Kan* V % 
kin, the commission’s chief counsel — %nd not the FBI .y r . / 

or anylx^ty else." The commission replied awl agreed

The two showcfl Shaffer the blown-up assasslna* C *•

• ThzJkzs* next had lunch together, .Sh* f fcr. gave 
Krakower lelcpliofic number* where he could be 
reached at his home and at his Justice Department 
and Warren Commission office*. Shaffer report cdtjr 
told them to call or write to him at any time and as* 
tured them that be would keep in touch with them. 1 
Harris and Krakower then returned to New York.! 

A few weeks later Harris finally learned that the 1 
man shown in the doorway had been reliably identified 
as one, Bj lly LoxjJv& y* * warehouseman at the Book 
Depository who had worked with Oswald. Unknown lo 
Harris and Krakower, Lovclady had been identified 
as the figure in the picture by the Flit the day after 
the assassination. '(This was, apparently, the source for 
the AP caption put, out on December Z) 

• This development did not deter Harris and Kra- 
kower. "What we wanj is conclusive proof that the 
man is not Oswald, not just the bland assurance H is 
I^ovclady," Krakower says. "There should be a total 
investigation of this facet of the case. The president of 
the American Bar Association was appointed ‘defense 
counsel* to Lrc Harvey Oswald by the Warren Com- 
mission, He should be allowed to cross-examine Love- 
lady as if Oswald were alive and on trial and had in- 
troduced this picture as evidence .in his defense. God, 

1 hope it isn't Oswald in the picture. But 1 want it 
established lieyond any d». d . t - nt -»41," 

For some two weeks after their Washington meet- 
ing, Shaffer and Krakower continued to communicate 
by mail and telephone. In a letter written early in 
March, Krakower pointedly referred to an article pub- 
lished in Commentary, which raised several provocative 
questions relative to the assassination and the in- , 
vestigation. lie has not since heard from Shaffer or* 
any other staff member of the commission. 

Because he believes the commission did not act 
in good faith with him, Krakower no longer feels bound 
to keep his pledge of silence. "In this ease, involving 
the assassination of the President of the United States, 
If there was any kind of conspiracy and the fact was 
concealed and I was in a position to contribute one 
scintilla of evidence and didn't do it, I wouldn't be 
able to live with myself/' he commented. "Where do 
I get off bucking the commission? Maybe belter minds 
are right. But you always end up saying the truth is 
the truth and no S.O.B. has a right to say it is not; 
Oswald unless he supplies proof. That's all we are 1 
asking. 1 pray it is Lovclady." .

Just asJhls-pkBtre was about to he snapped. This by- 
play went on for almost three weeks. Bdei man, liow- 
ever, was determined to succeed. One Friday as Lovc- 
lady was about to quit work, Beckman stationed him* 

[self outside on the sidewalk. He later described the 
I episode in a report: "At 4:40 I saw L and a blonde 
! (20 years) girl, I edged back and waited, camera poised. 

The girl, from around the corner, stampeded tip In a 
rage and slapped my right forearm and began on 
alMJsivc tirade." The "blonde girl," as Beckman later 
learned to his surprise, was Lovelady 9 * wife. Lovclady, 
meanwhile, had called a patrolman who was directing 
traffic and the three were taken to police headquarters. 

They were then transferred to the police surveillance 
office and after some questioning were released. Beck- 
man was advised to leave Dallas. • ; x r 'V 

lovclady is flatly unwilling, understandably so, 
to have his picture published. As he put it, in a Texas *

might take a shot at me because I look tike Oswald/^ 

Tic docs, in fact, bear a similarity to Oswald. He Ss 
about an inch shorter, stockier and his hair, sparse like^rr^V^-/ 
Oswald's, is a bit darker. But an impressionistic camera ,sf ^£^ 
image could minimize these differences. "Hell, Vm 
better lookin' fhan he was," Lovclady enjoys saying./ -V b 
Lovclady maintains it is he standing in the door*^ v ^ . - 
way at the moment of the assassination. "I was stand- 
ing on the first step," he tokl me when I interviewed - 

him two weeks ago in Dallas. "Several people hi the 
picture saw* me. That lady shading her eyes works here *; - r 
on the second floor " • 1 ■" */*';** *'!>/ j ; 

Lovclady said that the night following the assas- 
sination two FBI agents visited hk home. "They said 
they had a blown-up picture they wanted sne to see. 

Right away I pointed to me and they seemed relieved. 

One had a big smile on his face because it wasn't Os- 
wald. They said they had a big discussion down at 
I the FBI and one guy said it just had to be Oswald." 

JO • I 

c^wovclady recalled that shortly after the a ssassma-^/^/^:;/ ‘ 

[lion when Oswald's linage appeared and reappeared * 

on television programs, his two stepchildren, a boy i 

* six and 1 girl four, would point to the screen and sa 
, "There's daddy." I Ic said that while watching the motor-* '^V' 
cade from the doorway of the Book Depository he * 
distinctly heard three shots — "there was one, thcii a [ 
pause and two fast ones" In the confusion dial fol- 3 v 
lowed he said he rail 75 to 100 yards to where the* #i ;v 
. Presidential limousine had been, "but, man, they were 
going by that time." He returned to the warehouse and \r 
a roll call was taken of the dozen or so men in his VT 
work gang. Only Oswald was missing. V-V - - ; 

I»vclady remembers that on the morning of No- 
vember 22, the day of the assassination, he had seen 
Oswald on the sixth floor of the warehouse.^."! was 
putting in some flooring and he came over and asked 
about some book orders.* We had a 10 o'clock break, 
then went back to work until noon, when we knocked 
off for lunch and to see the President" He said he 
could not recall whether Oswald went downstairs with 
the r est of fli c men because both were working on 
And besides, Oswald didn't mingle much,

Z days ago, still brooding over the picture; 
Jones Harris flew to Dallas, met with Lovclady and 
talked with him for about a quarter of an hour. 
Lovclady told him, yes, it we# he standing in the 
I doorway. Ix>veJ ady also told him that the FBI had* 
'taken several pictures of him, presumably to com- 
pare with the AP picture of the assassination scene.* 
Lovclady also said that oil November 22 he was wear- 
ing a red -and -white striped sport shirt buttoned near 
the neck. * 

Harris left Dallas still unconvinced. "I admit 
there is a strong resemblance between Lovclady and 
the blow-up of the figure standing in the doorway, r 
he said. "But the figure in the picture docs not appear 
to be wearing a striped shirt and it is buttoned very 
low, showing much of his white T-shirt. Why doesn r 
| the FBI or the Warren Commission have Lovclady 
pose in the doorway and have Altgcns take a picture 
from the same distance and with the same camera as 
on November 221" ; i \ V . 

Altgcns,* one of the very few witnesses who was 
close enough actually to see the President shot, Is 
aide to describe In minute detail what happened at 
(hat terrible moment Yet, he has never been ques- 
tioned by the FBI or the Warren Commission* 

The Warren Commission Is expected to release 
Its full report on the assassination of President 
Kennedy in a matter of weeks, perhaps before June 
Is out Jones Harris hopes the report will resolve 
all his doubts about the identity of the man In the* 
doorway* Until then, Harris insists 
"It's all very strange," he says. #

According to the wish of your brother John Fitzgerald Kennedy, ; 

I wish to give you the true background details of the* crime, now that V 

half year has gone by since the Dallas assassination. I had several ;? 

telephonic conversations v/ith your brother. The last one took place in 7^'.. , 
August of last year. In the beginning, Mr. Johnson who is now President, ^ 
used to join in the conversations also. ** • 'J'~~ f 

At the time, your brother John F. requested me to contact, fe/f V ’ • j 
you when this date would roll around. Nobody knows of the secret .a^£^^T ". | 


confidential relation between your brother and r‘ • ?•» - •

It has cost me a great deal of effort not to write this let- 
ter to you before. As I mentioned previously, your brother, John F. ^ 
Kennedy, had asked me to wait until now. - 


; j w > . 


I want to let you know confidentially that I had foreseen -^^wy. 
the assassination of your brother. I also know quite accurately the ^♦ip- 
precise circumstances of the Dallas assassination. • - ... ■■ 

Therefore, I shall be looking forward to hearing from you : 

'in the near future.

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT 
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, 
NOVEMBER 22, 1963 
DALLAS, TEXAS 




•>- ft i ' V ... ■**' ' 


A confidential source abroad advised that investigation ~ 
was conducted in the city of St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada, on May 25, 
1964, in regard to the anonymous letter postmarked St. Thomas,*: 
Ontario, April 27, 1964, and addressed to the Dallas office of rr: 

the FBI. -• •• N. . ^ r r -' *" ' tVWwrS 1 " Jvi*-*- *' v ~ r‘t r ' 


In the opinion of the source, the letter originated 
with a patient in the Ontario Hospital, a mental institution -v t-; 
located in St. Thomas. Dr. K. McGregor, Assistant Superintendent, ; 
was interviewed but could not identify the handwriting in the 
letter and stated that the envelope and paper used are not 
identical to that supplied to patients by the hospital. He also 
stated that numerous patients from this institution are allowed, 
considerable freedom, including the privilege of visiting downtown 
St. Thomas during daylight hours. There would, therefore, be .. 
nothing to prevent a patient from purchasing writing paper and : -.-- 
envelopes in St. Thomas and mailing letters from the Post Office,; _ 
Dr. McGregor knows of no one who was or had been upset In respect 
to the assassination of President Kennedy. Dr. McGregor further, 
stated the hospital records contained no reference to Jack Webber ~ 
or Jack Frasher,

Under and around a photograph of Jack Ruby, the sender wrote: 


"The biggest secret of the world rests with this

The four-page letter reads: 


srote: ^

■V * * 


n ; r 


"In response to and to the attention of Lawyer Mark 
Lane and Justice Earl. Warren, member of the 
mission Investigating the stupid death of President „ 
Kennedy, of fond memory. The lives of the members - 
of your Investigating commission are in serious 7 
jeopardy and I am positive In reporting this because 
the guilt or involvement In this plot is as strong as 
a hurricane. The fact of the matter is that Lee Oswald ^77 -A 
did not kill Kennedy, but his rifle was used..* • 

"Lee Oswald was the bearer of a secret and it is regret- : . 
table that he was not surrounded by security measures . % / 
until he told everything of interest to the U. S. A. and 
to the world. For this reason, the police had to silence 
him forever by tossing dirt and a shovelful of lime on* 
the matter of Kennedy* s death. Lee Oswald had no 
inkling that his life was in danger, not even when he . 
was still at large. He was keeping the secrets that he^ 
had received from the members of the plot. It was a 
plot deserving trustworthiness and respect because 
it involved the cream of the Dallas society, including XX • 
the famous FBI. ■ ■■ : .7 

"Oswald did not know that he had been chosen as the 
scapegoat. The fact is that he had all damaging r ■ 
characteristics as a rebellious man of bad communist 
conduct who had used forged documents, in addition, 
of course, to the frame-up arranged by the police. 

"The famous FBI was shaken by the terror of having 
favored Oswald when he was free* It feared that a line- : — 
up would be necessary on account of the various reports . C 
against him which followed the firing of the shots. 
such line-up took place. After he killed the policeman,'^- 1 
he knew that he would be executed and might have spilled 


- 2 - 






everything about the plot. Also, Oswald was held .v, '.>1 

in Dallas as a ’’persona non grata.” Therefore, the 

plot was organized against him and Kennedy, both ' 


having to die on the same day. If Oswald had not been ; 
a person so well cast for the role of scapegoat, our ~ 

friend Kennedy would still be alive. Very few people 
in Dallas knew that the plot would involve the death! ; 
of the President. Even the members of the Police J 
Force knew nothing, acting under superior orders, C 
•'like orders transmitted to members of the guard * . 

detail of troops at rest. The policemen who escorted - > 

•'Oswald knew nothing about it; only that they were to 
try to deliver him to Ruby. . -;- 1 - / _ ; ^ ^ . _ 

”As we have seen, various plans were premeditated, ~~i ' /* 

including killing Oswald right at the time of his arrest, 
calling it self-defense. As we have seen, he had no ^ t ' 
luck and, under a shovelful of lime, he cannot be 
questioned (?) as to his secret and the shot fired bf.'^ 

Oswald was fatal. . ' -V-'-vr >;:/ v ; " 5^; - 

”The patrolman’s death and the imprisonment of Oswald _?■*. » 

alive were a fishbone stuck in the throat of the criminals 

who, as long as Oswald lived, had everything to lose 

because of this phrase: 'You wanted to kill the President 

and he was already dead.' All of this was an attempt 

to bring about his being set up for the shooting (?). ■ . ~ • 

Thus far, we have already seen various such pre- 
meditated attempts. 


"The FBI was forced to lay hands on the second 
triumph (?) of premeditation: Ruby; a man who was i:, 

Judged a man easy to pass off as a maniac and an 
epileptic - the plot is so well organized, it even •" 

Includes psychiatrists - Ruby would kill Oswald and r . 

\ pass for mentally deranged; would not be sentenced to — - 

death and even if he wanted to talk, he would not 
rate credence by the authorities who wanted to know 
the truth. 

"When he was given a negative expert’s. report, another 
fishbone got 6tuck in the throat of President Kennedy’ s; ^ . . 
slayers; a fishbone even bigger than Ruby's life with 
his appeal to continue staying alive for a longer time. ^ xV- 


- . - .*>•’ '*.* • • * > ■ 




> - 


"Only those who do not know the secrets of Kennedy's 
death do not want Ruby's execution. The criminals • 
will be able to set him up for assassination the fastest 
possible, unless they manage to get him to a safe place :*&:• 
before (?) he tells everything. That is why I am sending 
this outline - it is to avoid a lot of delay. 

"Ruby was another scapegoat chosen to approach - 

Oswald at the police station for the purpose Of put- 

ting a hole through him with certain advantages as ■ i 3 ? 

described by the press. For this reason, the FBI ;■ 

took .the precaution of sounding out Oswald's mother 

by showing her Oswald's (sic) picture before he killed 

him since Ruby was acting together with her son. / - : v 




"The police, knowing that Oswald had a wife, wanted 
him to take the shots; he refused, but was left with 
the secret, which then led to the double murder, 
against Kennedy and against him. Then, they ordered him 
to furnish the rifle, Intimating that he would die one 
way or another and the shovelful of lime would be cast. ~ 

"The Governor and his wife are the only authorities ^ .' r ; , 
in Dallas who knew nothing and still know nothing, V: : 
also with respect to who is plotting (?) for Ruby's death ^ - 
penalty. They are innocent because the situation of the a 
culprits drives them to kill as fast as they can to wrap - 

things in silence. . .. • * ' - 

• * 

"Those responsible for Kennedy's death are already sorry • 
because all their plans for a perfect crime are failing . 
and, moreover, they did not think that Kennedy's death' 
would have so many repercussions abroad; even 
suicides by fans of his and the clamors of the chieftains ; ' ' 
of the communist conspiracy (?) who were certain that 
Kennedy would not take the country to war because he knew 
that modern war is useless. 

"In short, he who killed Kennedy was the same who - - 
aimed the gun at Oswald claiming that the jail would 
not have him; the policeman who was carrying a rifle r ^ _ 
knew everything and was carrying the rifle to attract 
the human mass against Oswald in order to set him up 
because the radio was asking for it. >: J

"The Chief of Police knew, because of his precaution 
to keep more than ten yards away from the Presidential 
limousine and because of his broadcasts on approaching 
the building but not to catch the police (?). The master- 
minds also strongly suspected that they would yet permit ^ • 
the Chief of Police and certain trustworthy members 
of the FBI to testify on behalf of the prosecution. . * : > = 

"So many calamities afflicted the criminals In tholr cover- 
up efforts that even Mark Lane's defense presents many 
gaps and confusion because a crime against the Chief ~ 
Executive of the country, the most highly thought-of 
man in the world. In the full light of day, in the center 
of a big city - there still are people who claim that the r. 
shots came from the front of the limousine and that they 7 
did not take those witnesses because of conspiracy 
and, for example those where Oswald killed the patrolman? 
(Sic) • : 

"As an observing scientist I do not find that the Investigat- 
ing commission is placing (?) its hand on the main culprit. 

I remain, •

Dear Mr. Attorney Generali APR 17 1964 * 

t:n:. Bi-.WCH J; M 

A Mr. Johnny Carson, Host *of the J 
Tonight Show is a Comciunl ■ U i . ■ o re ■ can y' 

front organizations as well which are affiliated 
with the Communist Party here 'in America. 

I know for a positive fact that oh..’ 
November 21, 1963* on a Thursday night he was - - • 
sent a wire telling him that your brother was 
going fo be shot the following day while on 
route to make a speech. I know he is because 
I know the person who sent him the wire. I 
at the time didn't know what this wire contained 
The man told me later. He also told me plenty 
about the Communist Conspiracy -operating in this 
country. This man thinks that I am a good pros- 
pect for the Communist Party he doesn't know 
that I'm a member of the National Christian 
Crusade, headed by Billy James Hargis. I was 
shocked when he told me about the advances that 

( the Party has made in the country during the 
past 10 years. Please let the P. B. I. know 1'! 
about this and have Mr. Carson investigated at - 
once. If this is true what this man said to 
me regarding him and the Communist Party in^.-:rr 
America and I don't believe that he would have 7 
said this unless it were true - then this Mr. 
Johnny Carson should be brought before the ■ 
Un-American Activities Committee right away. 

I cannot give my name. I think that you under- 
stand why. . 

Respectfully yours, 

P.S. The one that sent the wire is my boss. 

That's is why I can't give .his name. -

av ttuvioc * uu >£L ur ^ooenxx uince ootainea a copy or a letter § 
written by (Thomas Lloyd /Thomson /presently Incarcerated in Phoenix, to the . 
editor of "LlfV^magazihe. This letter in part agrees with recent \ J . 

scurrilous editorial in "Life” criticizing the Director and accuses the V 'J , 
FBI and Secret Service of being responsible for President Kennedy’s death.-) 
Thomson also restates an allegation concerning the assassination which r v 
has been previously found to be false. ••J /\ V ' 

DETAILS /ft 

Phoenix by airtel 6-1-64, transmitted a copy of a letter' dated 
5-27-64, to the editor of "Life" magazine written Joy Thomas Lloyd Thomson'- 
an inmate of the Uarlcopa County Sheriff’s Office; Phoenix, Arizona, Z 
which was furnished by an employee of the sheriff's office. §' 

Thomson’s letter states he agrees with the scurrilous editorial 
recently printed in "Life” and feels the FBI and Secret Service are 8 - 
responsible for President Kennedy’s death. He alleges while employed if?* 
Fort Worth, Texas, he was told of an ex-Uarine who had spent a couple off 
years in Russia and that he advised the FBI of this information. Thoms6to . 
claims his complaint was treated lightly although he was later interviewed 
by. the Secret Service based on his complaint to the FBI. He also Q 

criticized the Secret Service Agent who interviewed him. . g» 

M Thomson blames the FBI for not survellllng Oswald since he - 

"personally" informed the FBI of Oswald's existence. This is a ~ ’ f 
misrepresentation of the true facts as he never mentioned Oswald’s name to 
us until 3-25-64, as explained later in this memorandum. He concludes by 
telling the editor of "Life" he thinks "J. Edgar Hoover should be forced 
to retire....” yf 


FACTS 4 4 4:. - REC* 34 (s7) /( ' f f < ( 

Phoenix by teletype 11-23-63, advised Thomson on 11-22-63, * - 

alleged he overheard, about six months previously, James Thomas and 
Floyd Rasmussen (phonetic) state they would like to kill President Kennedy. 
No mention of Oswald was made at this time. This information was furnished 
to Secret Service' on 11-23-63, (62-109060-869). »’a v/.’

In the possession of the Bureau is an exhibit described as 
"one spent rifle hull,” Conraission Exhibit 5^3/ FBI Laboratory 
jjfflrt_it_Q-H8. Will you please forward this exhibit to Dallas for 
inspection by Captain Fritz and Detective Dhority of the Dallas 
Police Department. Iherc is a mark on this rifle hull which has 
not been identified. It is cither "C.D." or "V.D." *If the mark 
is "C.D.," it was probably mode by C. N. Dhority, Dallas Police . 
Department. ‘ If the mark is "V.D.," it was probably made by Vince J 
Drain of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ' f 

A conference between Drain, Fritz, and Dhority will probably 
result in an identification of these initials. . ••

As one who Is responsible for the organization which is collecting all of the facts 
surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy* you are no doubt aware of the ”r 
many serious questions have been raised by responsible citizens, organizations, and 
publications regarding the guilt or innocence of Lee Harvey Oswald and the possih&p i 
involvement of other persons in a conspiracy. There seems to be a growing feelix^ j 
among astute citizens that the general public has not been given all of the facts! 
Press releases in recent days indicate that the report of the Warren Commission 
will corroborate information already given by the Dallas Police Department and 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I would like to believe that Lee Harvey 
Oswald did in fact act alone. However, I find it extremely difficult in view 
| of the number and nature of the questions which have been raised. 

I firmly believe that all of the facts, whatever they may involve, should be givSh 
to the American people. I further believe in the ability of our people to compre- * 
hend and act responsibly no matter what the real facts behind the assassination 
might be. . „ .. . _ . - - vie-.-... v... . / _ 

I trust that you will use* every means in your power to in sure-, that all of the 
facts are brought to light and that the real reasons for the^ass assinat ion of 

President Kennedy are given to the American people, * .

( | r : ■'-*■ : - ': NOVEMBER 22, 1963, DALLAS, TEXAS

Bamboo Inn, a cafe in Kennewick, . _ < .- ; *' 

Investigation also was conducted on May ^ 31, 1952 , ' 

which reflected that Mary’s Dog House, C and Washington - 

Streets, Kennewick, which is owned by ARTHUR DE WITT, is 
small harbuypor stand catering tp^Ju veniles -and the v hotrodj!> - -•/•

In July of 1953, as a res ulj: , format ion received 

by the Richland Police Department . j gSgpSraL? Juvenile Proba^

from 0^1 f | P 1 * more de non^jfo le juveffiles who indicated to him that

On August 29, 1958, information reflect- 

ing that ARTHUR CHESTER DE WITT, (FBI Number was 
a candidate for Sheriff of Walla Walla County. . DE WfTT • 
i reportedly had the backing of numerous "extremists," one of - ' ,y 
/ whom is WILLIAM H. HAROLD, who edits the Walla WallaStatesman, 
which is privately printed, and which is anti-Communist, anti- 
Semitic, and pro-constitutional party. DE WITT had distributed 
a pamphlet indicating that he is a candidate .for sheriff and - 
outlines his platform, pointing out that his grandfather arrived 
. , in Walla Walla in 1863 on an ox team*, also that both he and M ' 
his father were born in Walla Walla. The current sheriff and

^candidate for re-el y Hep . JOH N CUMMINGS . advised that 
DE WITT* (£BI Number a s a record dating back 
£arch 29, 193'H stated that in 19SS DE WITT was held bfl 
Vthe Sheri ff’s'Tjfl ice at Pasco on a sanity investigation^ 

- ' On February 18, 1963, Sergeant ROBERT FARNKOFF,^^^? " 

Kennewick Folice Department, advised that he received a 
letter addressed to MART DE WITT, Kennewick, Washington , dated - 
February 9, 1963, which she received from EARL ROSTOCK, Emmett, y*; 
Idaho. MARY DE WITI stated that she knew neither EARL ROSTOCK v; 
nor a TOM DAY, who was referred to in the letter as having a 
large quantity of merchandise for sale. Sergeant rARMKOFF'^^K! 
described MARY DE WITT as Chinese and as working and residing V 
at the Bamboo Inn, a Chinese restaurant -operated by her parents ' 
at 626 West Columbia, Kennewick, Washington. According to 
Sergeant FARNKOFF, MARY DE WITT is divorced from ARTHUR DE n' ^ 
WITT, who runs a hamburger stand at Kennewick and who is a • ; 

"nut." Sergeant FARNKOFF stated that it was possible that 
this letter was some sort of practical joke. : * 

% i ' . - , ‘ " * *-A*. 

/ f Investigation has developed that about two months V - 

ago DE WITT closed Kafy*s Dog House and opened a shoe shine 
parlor on West Lewis in Pasco. While in Kennewick, most of - ; - 

DE WITT’s business consisted of selling used, trashy magazines 
and books. Although he is ostensibly in the shoe shine busi- 
ness, he continues to have a back room full of cheap magazines, 
and he reportedly has photographs of nude women for sale. 
Investigation has developed that DE WITT employed two girls 
to shine shoes, but that there was little business. .^ 

Investigation at Pasco, Washington, since the latter '** • 
part of November, 1963, reflects that ARTHUR DE WITT plans to 
leave Pasco and go to Florida because he is subject to ridicule 
since he sent flowers to the funeral of LEE HARVEY OSWALD. *. 
Further investigation reflected that a rock was thrown through 
his window as a result of his having sent the flowers to 
OSWALD'S funeral. . , ; , > _ - . -

November 27, 1963, that ARTHUR C. DE WITT, Pasco, Washington 
had sent flowers to funeral of LEE HARVEYOS^lLlLy-pallas , •*> - 1 * •* • 
November 26, 1963. DE WITT, (FBI NumberE2S*£7 admitted 
sending a $6 spray to OSWALD in Dallas on the morning of • 

November 26, 1963. DE WITT stated although it was "an impulsive

‘act ," he would do it again. The reason for doing it wa s'Ms^^^*^' 
because OSWALD had not been tried and only conflicting reports 
regarding his guilt had been made. He said if he had known 
with certainty OSWALD had shot the President, he certainly 
would not have sent flowers. DE WITT said that he. was cer-^J; ; ^C^_ 
tain no one else would send any flowers, so he decided he 
would. He does not know OSWALD, RUBY, nor anyone connected 
with the President’s assassination or killing of OSWALD* 

DE WITT was last in Dallas when he hitchhiked through with [ 
wife and child in 1936. . ..•> 


fT" The floral shop in Kennewick, Washington, which 

sent flowers for DE WITT advised they telephoned the order to 
Webb Royal Flowers, 166 Webb Royal Shopping Center, Dallas, r ":^X 
around 9 AM, November 26, 1963, and advised they would deliver 
a spray to OSWALD'S residence. No message was sent with the 
order. DE WITT said he sends "lots of flowers" to people who V 
might not otherwise get any. The floral shop in Kennewick - 
which sent the flowers stated DE WITT frequently does things 
like this. The Pasco Police Department characterized DE WITT ... - 
as an eccentric and generally regarded as a "nut” by Pasco • v - . 
people. . ..... „ .. ...... ..v:^.;r.v 

On May 14, 1964, W. J. PENNINGTON, Business Manager 
of the Seattle Times, advised that the following advertisement 
had been called in by KAY HOPPER for ARTHER DE WITT, a magazine 
store owner at 1108 First Avenue, Seattle, Washington: ~ - 

"All persons who believe in LEE OSWALD'S innocence ^

Investigation at 1108 First Avenue revealed a used 
magazine store recently opened and advertising that it buys, 
sells, and trades magazines. A cursory view reflected a large 
number of nude-type magazines for sale and the place seemed 
to deal in pornographic-type magazines. On the window of the 
magazine store were several pages of articles clipped from 
the "National Guardian," which articles questioned that OSWALD 
actually killed President KENNEDY. There were also signs in,.;

^he window which stated, "Where is the Warren Report?" 

• ... ''What Your Newspaper Dares Not Print. 

• ; ' ^ On June 1, 1964, investigation at 1108 First Avenue 

reflected that additional printing had been included on the 
window front of the used magazine store reflecting that ARTHUR CV 
DE WITT had left Pasco, Washington, because he had sent flowers \ 
to the funeral of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, which had resulted in -i- 
someone throwing a rock through the window of his store, causing 
a thousand dollars* worth of damage to him. Also on the store . .. 
front was printing which challenged the FBI, the CIA, and the 0^-: 
Secret Service to develop the truth about the assassination,^ 
alleging that these Federal agencies had backed the wrong - . 

organization in accepting the Dallas Police Department version \' : 
that OSWALD had killed President KENNEDY. DE WITT also had *r : ^' 
information on the store front reflecting that he was very 
familiar with bolt action guns and that the angle of the shots 
that hit Governor CONNELLY and President KENNEDY indicated “ 
that they could not have been fired by a bolt action gun from r; 
the sixth floor of the bookstore. DE WITT also had statements 
on the magazine store stating that the Warren Report was not 
going to be issued in 'our lifetime. He had a letter from :/ 
the Seattle Times dated in May of 1964, which stated that it ~ 
was not the policy of the Seattle Times to print the ad requested 
for DE WITT, and DE WITT’s comment was that this indicated that 
the Seattle press was biased and that only the "National Guardian" 
printed the truth. . ..

to regard Oswald as a suspect in that attempted murder until 
December 3, 1963. when Marina Oswald furnished information -hot ^ 
Oswald hod. on tne night in question, attempted to kill General 
Walker. Tne Dallas Police Department has also indicated tnnt it *-; •

On June 3, 1964, FRANK C. AKERS, 4740 Richard, Fort V; 
Worth, Texas, admitted sending a telegram to the Department of V 
Justice In May 1964, stating that he wished to testify before - 
the President' e Commission. He stated that now he does not 
think he should have sent the telegram because he cannot furnish 
any Information concerning the assassination of former President 
JOHN F. KENNEDY. He does not know DEE HARVEY OSWALD or JACK 
RUBY, and cannot furnish any information concerning OSWALD or ~ 
RUBY. , ■ ' ., ... . ; ... • . 

AKERS stated that he sent the telegram because he 
wanted to discuss with the President's Commission the security ; ; 
aspects of the United States In general as It applies to both;' ' 
the civilian employees of the Government and military. AKERS. 
said he has nothing specific, but from What he has seen as a 
former Government employee and the people with Whom he has -•* ~. 
talked, it is his opinion that too many people in the Govern- ; 
ment are doing as they please and not doing the Job they are 
hired to do. .. \'-’V -

AXERS' last Job was with the United States Army ; ; - 
Reserve, 300th Aviation company. Fort Worth, Texas, as a 
civilian employee. He was discharged approximately January 1, 
1963, for not doing his Jobi specifically, his failure to , .••• 
order parts and inspect parachutes. He appealed his case and 
has heard nothing more. i 


AXERS said that another reason that he sent the 
■telegram was because at his former employment with the Army " . ' 
Reserve he felt no attention was paid to security of the 
premises, such as allowing unauthorized persona to have access 
to the premises, to come and go as they please.; . V’

On 5/12/64, Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the > 
President’s Commission, requested by letter that the cartridge cases 
C6, C7 and C38 recovered from the Texas School Book Depository be 
examined for loading, chambering, extraction and/or ejection marks. On 
5/15/64, Mr. Melvin Eisenbcrg, staff member, orally requested that the 
aforementioned cartridge cases as well as the C8 cartridge found in 
the assassination weapon (C14) be examined to determine if they had - 
been loaded into and extracted from the C14 rifle more than once. 

Mr. Eisenberg advised that this type of examination was actually 
meant in Rankin's letter of 5/12/64. As a result of the examinations 
{conducted on these items in the Laboratory the following results were 
J obtained and are set forth below: - . 


Marks were found on the C6 cartridge case indicating that 
J it has been loaded into and extracted from a weapon at least three * 

' times. One set of marks was identified as having been made by the . 
magazine follower of the C14 rifle. It Is pointed out that the 3 * »: 
extractor and ejector marks on C6 as well as on C7, C8 and C38 did 
not possess sufficient characteristics for Identifying the weapon 5 
which produced them. There are also three sets of marks on the ba&e 
of this cartridge case which were not found on C7, C8, C38 or any3of N ' 
the numerous tests obtained from the C14 rifle. It was not possible- 

to determine what produced these marks. ... w-i.* O f,

« Marks were found on the C7 cartridge case indicating th$t s N

One set of marks was identified as having been produced by the 
chamber of the C14 rifle and one set of marks was identified as 
having been produced by contact with the bolt of C14j however, it 
was Dot possible to determine whether the two sets of marks which were

1 (found in the C14 rifle) which were identified as having been ^ 

J produced by the magazine follower of the C14 rifle* Another 
set of follower marks was found on C8, The fragmentary nature ^>5 
of this ^et of marks could possibly account for the fact that 
these marks were not identified with the C14 rifle* 


. ,r *'tr Jr . • 


Harks were found on the C38 cartridge case indicating "42^ ~ 

J that it had been loaded into and extracted from a weapon at leastj^g^ 
twice* One set of marks was identified as having been produced 
by the magazine follower of the C14 rifle and one set of marks 
was identified as having been produced by the chamber of C14; 

I however, it was not possible to determine whether the two sets yyy-- yy. 
of marks which were identified were produced by one or two ^22444^ - 
loading operations* in the C14 rifle* 


*•* 


The results of the above examinations do not preclude 
the possibility that these items could have been loaded into 
and extracted from a weapon one or more times when insufficient 
force was used to produce marks* It is pointed out that if two 
or more cartridges are loaded into the clip of C14, only the y 
bottom cartridge will be marked by the magazine follower* y 




Dallas is being furnished the results of these 
examinations* . .... .

orqer to de tor/nine whether or not the photographs in the 


various publications originated from the photograph of Oswald 
holding the rifle , Commission Exhibit 133, It was not 
possible to positively associate these photographs since 
the photographs in the publications are reproductions by 
halftone process, normal to such reproductions, end do not 
contain as much detail as the photographs from which 
engraved halftone plates were made. In addition, this Io3S 
of detail tends to conceal retouching that is normally •» . ^ 
placed on photographs for the purpose of intensifying ; • 

details that would otherwise be* lost in the engraving process*";' ’ >V 
However, a comparison of the photograph which is a part of Ci-oL- 

Commission Exhibit 133 with the photographs and reproductions | ^ ; A: 
described above , shows that all of the photographs and 
reproductions are consistent in all general characte ris tics', v j 


•** * | 



that r.c* characteristics were found that would suggest that 
the photographs and reproductions of photographs, described 
above, originated fron other than the photograph that is a ' 
part of CocuT.i scion E>diibit 133 or a duplicate print of that 
photograph. ■ ■ - .

■ ■ "Warren Commission Inquiry t 

"Assassination of President Kennedy 
reconstructed in Dallas details 


"The Warren Commission moved yesterday 
to the reconstruction of the attempt at Dallas 
on President Kennedy, Lee Rapkin, counselor 
and speaker for the Commission, stated that the 
FBI agents who had taken part in the reconstruc- 
tion were specifically charged with verifying 
the exact position of the automobiles in the pres- 
idential procession, the position of the persons 
in the autos at the time the shots were fired, 
and the aiming of the gun. The agent taking the i 
part of Kennedy had a chalk marking on his back 
at the point where the first bullet hit the Pres- 
ident, At the back of his head a piece of plaster 
indicated the exact point of entry of the third 
bullet, which killed the President, A second 
agent took the part of Governor Connolly, He 
wore the suit worn by Connolly the day of the 
attempt and the hole in the material made by the 
bullet was circled with white chalk. A third 
agent, an expert marksman, was at the window on

the 6th floor of the building housing the book 
depository from where the gunshots were fired, 
and using the crime weapon he repeated the actions 
of the assassin. * •• ; 




"Using many photographs of the attempt, the 
FBI agents sought to reconstruct with the maxi- 
mum accuracy possible all the details of that 
tragic event. The traffic had been stopped. 

Many movie cameras filmed the proceedings from 
diverse angles, including one fixed on the crime 
weapon. • y.. • 

"An analagous reconstruction had been made 
by the Secret Service shortly after the attempt. 

"The U.S. Hews and World Peport magazine 
carries a summary of what it considers the con- 
clusive report of the Warren Commission, The re- 
port is to be made public next month. The essential 
points of the report are: 


"D All the evidence obtained -indicates 
Lee Harvey Oswald to be the assassin of Kennedy; 
he acted alone without being a part of any con- 
spiracy; • - • 


"2) Rumors of a 'plot*, either of the 
extreme right or extreme left, are to be considered 
totally unfounded; 

" "3) Jack Ruby, who killed Oswald on 
Hovember 24, 2 days after the death of Kennedy, 
was acting alone and on his own initiative, without 
having any specific connection with Oswald; 


’ "4 ) Oswald had neither help nor encour- 

agement from either the UCSP, China, Cuba, enemies, 
supporters of racial integration, or groups of the 
extreme right or left. 


■ "i- ’ . 


"According to the publication, the Warren 
: Report refutes the following 'rumors' which were" 
^‘ circulated after the death of Kennedy: . • . 


; v.i - 'i . •,/ .v 


- 2 - 


P*JK\ 








g 


»D That it was a question of a plot _ . 

. ' of the extreme right; ' - 0 ^^ 

"2> That the Government exerted pressure • 
on theDalbs Police Department and eliml- ; 

nated evidence of conspiracy; 

"3) That four instead of three sl 2 ot ® 

fired and that one of these came fron^the 

railroad overpass in front of the pre 
dential car; 

h | i \ T hat Puby killed Oswald to keep him 
from urtor that someone in Pallas wanted 
Oswald to be kept from talking. 

Rome is continuing to follow this _matter^ Any

the assassination of President KENNEDY* (It should be noted v ^ j 
that Dr* FOWLER is rumored to be a potential Republican candi- j 

date for the U* S* Congressional seat currently held by Repre- 
sentative JOHN BLATNIK.) 

1 1 First, Dr* FOWLER played a tape recording of the in- 

-v. Ijterview of OSWALD, which presumably was the interview conducted V’ 1 
New Orleans relating to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, l flu) * 

Vp : Dr* FOWLER stated he has been well acquainted with • 

General WALKER, of Texas, and had been in General WALK ER jj* room 
sometime in the past when an individual, CARLO or jCARLO^VANBENZ A f 
had had a conference with General WALKER* Dr. FOWIER indicated'”*' 5 *' 
that this CARLOS VANBENZA was a Cuban..rejCugee attorney. who had 
had a debate with OSWALD in the taped recording above referred 
to* Be said VANHENZA (phonetic) is now a reporter for, a Chicago " 
paper. : : . 

* his comments. Dr* FOWIER attributed the shooting 
at General WALKER to OSWALD, claiming that OSWALD had deliber- 
ately missed General WALKER* He charged that it was a definite 
jjfact that there was a Communist Party cell in Dallas which had 
// six members, two of whom were JACK RUBY and LEE OSWALD. 

V:V; He charged that the circumstances leading to the 

'•••. assassination of President KENNEDY arose from the fact that 
A- Mr. KENNEDY and Mr. KHRUSHCHEV had gone soft on one another v 

- *-* u- - and that both of them wanted to get rid of CASTRO* An agree- 
ment was made between them according to which KHRUSHCHEV was 
to allow Mr. KENNEDY to get rid of CASTRO provided Mr. KENNEDY - 
would permit Cuba to remain Communistic* Mr. CASTRO heard of 
this arrangement and began his own operation* 

V Dr* FOWLER charged that OSWALD had made a trip to 

I Mexico before the assassination* He allegedly returned to the 
/ United States in the company of one QUENTON PENZA (phonetic). 

I OSWALD had $10,000 in his possession and bad been given the 
/ Job of assassinating President KENNEDY. It was intended that 
I PENZA, after the assassination, was to take OSWALD to Cuba. 

Immediately following the assassination, OSWALD was supposed 
to take a taxi to a location near RUBY*s home and thereafter,. * 

v be picked up by a representative of PENZA. OSWALD was to have ! | 

worn a certain-colored jacket for identification* Contrary to----- ^ 

• instructions, OSWALD had gone to his home and had apparently 
put on a different jacket, thus causing a delay in his being - *i

Admiral Berkley said he was in the motorcade at 
Dallas on 11/22/63 a few cars behind President Kennedy when 
ho was assassinated. His car took him immediately to the 
hospital in Dallas and he was in the emergency room 
with the body at the time the Dallas doctors were attempting 
to work with him. Admiral Berkley said that he gave advice 
concerning the President’s blood type and medication at the 
time the Dallas doctors were considering giving the President 
a blood transfusion. Following this Admiral Berkley stayed * 
close to Mrs. Kennedy and returned to Washington with ] : 

Mrs. Kennedy, the President’s body and the new President 
Johnson. Admiral Berkley said that he prepared a memorandum v t 
concerning his actions and submitted a copy to Mrs. Kennedy ft 

and a copy to the U. S. Secret Service, lie indicated that he 0 

has never been called by any member of the Warren Commission g 

concerning his knowledge of the events at Dallas and he is of g

record. Admiral Berkley asked Mr. Bartlett if the Bureau would B 
mention this to an appropriate member of the Warren Commission, g 
He was told that the Bureau would check into this matter. £=>' 


The Bureau is in possession of a copy of the Secret

effect that he had been riding in an automobile several cars behind President v\ 

Kennedy November 22, 1963, and had gone to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas ®

at the time the Dallas doctors were considering giving President Kennedy a blood 
transfusion. Admiral Berkley mentioned to Liaison Agent Orrin H. Bartlett that 
he had prepared a memorandum concerning his actions and submitted a copy to I 
Mrs. Kennedy and the U. S. Secret Service. He further advised that he had not ^ ' 

been called by any member of the Warren Commission concerning his knowledge v\ » 
of events at Dallas and he was of the opinion his statement should be made a part ^ ; 

of the record. * , T * ' . ^ IS 

This matter was discussed with J. Lee Rankin on June 8 , 1964, at which f* s

6-5-64 was tentatively set for hearing testimony. On 5-29-64 Mr. Specter called me f 
at home stating that Chief Justice Warren had advised Mr. Rankin that this testimony | 
should be moved up to 10:00 A. M. Thursday, 6-4-64 in order for him to be present. 1 

*;.••• - -4 

SAC Shanklin was able to have the Surveyor's work completed two days earlie: 
and at 10:00 P. M. 5-31-64 I obtained a tracing of the survey plat map from Captain '» 
Houton, AAL, at Friendship Airport inbound from Dallas. | 

. ' ' ■ - . <x 

The work of putting together the FBI's part of this assignment is being ] 
closely developed by all responsible Divisions. Mr. Specter wishes to be in a position 
to review this material before 6-4-64 if possible. He will be given the opportunity to 
discuss this matter with i^s as soon as the FBI's work has been completed. - ]

"ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT 

JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY — 

11/22/63, DALLAS, TEXAS 
MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING 


Arthur E. Sweeney, Saxony Court, Capo Coral, Florida, 
advised Florida Congressman Paul O. Rogors* Administrative 
Ass 1 b tat Robert Lochrlo on 12-6-63, that while visiting in 
Woodward, Oklahoma, in October, 1963, he commented to relatives 
that 7 ^ 1 airvpyant_ Jean” of Washington, D. C., predicted the 
President's assassination in tho August issue of "Faith" Magazine. > 

It was learned from the Reference Service of the / 

Library of Congress that the last issue of "Faith” Magazine in / 
the Library of Congress is dated December, 1942, and this / . 

- magazlno was reportedly published in Chicago, Illinois. 

It is possible that "Clairvoyant Jean” referred to 
' Above of Washington, D. C., is identical with one Mrs., Joan . 

^/pixon of Washington, D. C., who as of 1956 was associated with 
the James L. Dixon Real Estate Company and was a local repre- 
sentative of Damon Runyon Cancer Fundj^ ^ ~ 

A December 30, 1061, newspaper article refers to” 
one Jean Dixon as the "capital's, famed amateur ■ see?osa,^fli$5 t964 
It would appear eho is engaged in some manner with extrasensory 
perception. (62-42559-A Now York Journal American ar ticle by

-v : /*• - ' In view of the possibility that Jean Dixon may have ' M- 

written the article referred to by Mr. Sweeney, Washington Field _ 
should review magazine references at the Library of Congress in 
an effort to identify those magazines with "Faith” in'.’ their 
titles and review August, 1963, issues of same to locate an article 
authored by Joan Dixon. If the article is located, of forts should 
be made to obtain at least three coplos of the article for possible 
dissemination to the Presidents Commission. . . 

. ••• . .•••. v ■' ■■ 

_ In the event Washington Field’s efforts are negative, 
Chicago should endeavor to identify the publisher of "Faith” ■ 
and review the August, 1963, issue of same in an effort to locate 
the article portajLning to the President’s assassination. Likewise 
a minimum of three coplos of the article should bo obtained if 
possible. 

No information identifiable with "Clairvoyant Jean” 
could be located in Bureau files. ' - . 


Results of investigation should bo Incorporated in 
appropriate inserts for transmittal to the Bureau and Dallas for 
possible inclusion in a report for dissemination to the President’s 
Commission. 

You are reminded tho President’s Commission may wind up 
its inquiries in this matter in the very near future, and that > 
every effort should be made to expedite this investigation. 


NOTE; ' * ■ : 

Sweeney in furnishing this information, primarily 
mentioned the magazine in setting out comments made by his 
brothor-Jn-law concerning President Kennedy. This is being 
handled separately. However, in view of the information that 
a magazine predicted tho President’s death, it is felt it 
should be reviewed for possible dissemination to the Commission

telephonically by R. D. Rogge, 6-10-64.

NOVEMBER 22, 1963, DALLAS. TEXAS 

In the May 24, 1964, Issue o£ the "New YorX Herald

^BQNAFEDE captioned "The Picture With a Life Of Its Own,- ~ 

This article refers to the controversial Associated Press 
photograph of the Presidential motorcade Wherein an individual 
resembling LEE HARVEY OSWALD appears in the doorway of tha 
Texas School Book Depository. Previous investigation has 
identified this individual as BILLY N0 LAn/l 0VELADY. This 1 - ' 
article reflects that J, W. ALTGENS , a veteran Associated 
Press photographer ' in Dallas, Texas, recalled shooting the 
picture. The article further commented that ALTGENS had never 
been questioned by the FBI..

feet from the President when he took this photograph. He 
recalled that at about the instant he snapped the picture# ';YY 
he heard a burst of noise Which he thought was firecrackers. 

He advised he does not know how many of these reports he heard 
« since they had no significance to him at the time# and he was 
unaware of vhat was happening. 

After taking the above photograph# ALTGENS stated he 
then turned the film in his camera# adjusted the focus to 15 
feet and was raising his camera to eye level when he heard 
another report Which he recognized as a gunshot. He said the 
bullet struck President KENNEDY on the right side of his head 
and the impact knocked the President forward. ALTGENS stated 
pieces of flesh# blood and bones appeared to fly from the right 
side of the President's head and pass in front of Mrs. KENNEDY 
to the left of the Presidential limousine. ALTGENS stated Mrs. 
KENNEDY grabbed the President and ALTGENS heard her exclaim# 

"Oh# noi" as the President slumped over into her lap. ALTGENS 
. said he also observed blood on the left side of the President's 
. . head and face. ALTGENS stated he was staring in utter dis- 
4 .belief at What he had Just witnessed and was so aghast that he 
froze and did not snap the picture. AI/TGENS advised he was 
about fifteen feet from the President at this time# was sure 
the shot came from somewhere behind the President# and is 
positive this was the last shot fired. He said the President's 
car was proceeding at about ten miles per hour at the time. 

Al/TGENS advised he did 'not know Governor CONNALLY had 
also been shot since his attention was focused on the President. 
He said he learned from the wire services that Governor CONNALLY 
had been shot. 


ALTGENS stated the driver of the Presidential limousine 
apparently realized What had happened and speeded up toward the ‘ 
Stemmons Expressway. At this point# ALTGENS advised he took a 
‘photograph which depicted a Secret Service man standing on the 
back of the Presidential limousine# left side# assisting Mrs. Y'Y-'

KENNEDY back to her seat. ALTGENS stated the vfoole area seemed 
to be utter confusion. Police came from everyvfoere as the 
President's car disappeared from sight. .• 


* ALTGENS advised that as the President's car disappeared 

he observed some Secret Service Agents and police officers with 
drawn guns on the north side of Elm Street running in the direction 
of the top of the triple overpass. He said he thought they were 
chasing someone Who had fled from somewhere behind the President. 
ALTGENS related he also ran in this direction. After proceeding 
across Elm Street and up toward the triple overpass, ALTGENS 
stated he met the police officers returning. At this juncture, 
ALTGENS advised he then ran to a nearby telephone and informed 
his office that the President had been shot and that he had 
witnessed it. He then sprinted to his office in the Dallas News 
Building with the pictures he had taken. ALTGENS stated the 
pictures showing the President slumping in his seat with Mrs. 
XENNEDY bending over him 'moved "on the Associated Press Wire'photo 
Network at 12s 57 P.M., Which was seventeen minutes after the 
first news bulletin was sent out by Associated Press.

all turned in to Associated Press, and received wide publication 
and circulation, both in the United States and abroad. ALTGENS 
said he used a 35 mm Nikkorex camera with a 105 mm lens (tele- 
photo lens) • He said the camera was loaded with Eastman Kodak 
Tri-X film.

"Hew York Herald Tribune” which was based on information * 
furnished by Kr. Jones Harris to the President's Commission 
relating to the photograph of Billy Nolan Lovelady. 

Altgens took the photograph and the article revealed 
Harris had been requested not to publicize this information* 
However, Harris had felt the Commission had slighted him ; , 

- in not furnishing him the details in the Commission's 
possession about the situation. Therefore, he assisted 
in the preparation of the "Tribune” article* 

We have endeavored to interview every Individual 
possessing information concerning the assassination* 

However, Altgens* identity was never revealed and he 
never voluntarily came forward to furnish any information* 

The information regarding the fact Altgens had never been 
interviewed either by the Bureau or the President's 
Commission, not only appeared in the "Tribune** article, 
but appeared in the "Chicago American” in a column 
captioned "Daly Diary" written by Maggie Daly* The * 

Commission had prior interest in Jones Harris and with the

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT 

JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, . 

NOVEMBER 22, 1963, DALLAS. TEXAS 

On June 8, 1964, the following leaflet, dated June 1, 
1964, was received by the Dallas Office of the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, postmarked June 6, 1964, at Hominy, Oklahoma, 
and vfalch leaflet boars the name "Mrs. MARK E. MARTIN and 
Children, Hominy, Oklahoma", Who Is also known to have used the 
name SHIRLEY MARTIN*

, "Now that the Warren commission has leaked information 

that t.he first bullet to strike the President also 
penetrated Governor Connally and 'thrust* the Governor's 
body into the position it assumes in the Zapruder film, 
we must discredit Governor connally 's earlier statement 
that it was the sound of the first shot vrtiich made him 
turn into the position in which he received his wounds. 

f- .. 

* • "Is the Warren commission inferring (for the sake of 

history) that Governor Connally is a liar or a fool? 

Is history elso being asked to calumniate the Parkland 
doctors Who first. saLd one thing and the Bethesda 
doctors who later caid another? 


"What has become of the hematoma? The 2 or 3 inch 
penetration without damage to a vital organ? The 
bullet on 'a' stretcher at Parkland which fell there 
from the President's back? What has become of the 
'entry' neck wound, later a 'fragment tear' from the 
third bullet (but irreconcilable with the zapruder

bullet? What has become of the bullet damage 
to the windshield? To the bullet damage in 
the floor pan of the Presidential limousine? 

To the chrome deflection marks on the car? 

To the bullet embedded in the President's chest? 


r: M&mV: 


"Is no attention to be paid to the statement from 
a 'high White. House source' (November 23, 1963) 
that a bullet was removed from the President's 
chest at Bethesda, Md., Naval Hospital by autopsy 
doctors? To the statement made (November 22, 

1963) by Dr. Kemp Clark, nationally known neuro- 
surgeon, that the President's body left his charge 
at Parkland with a bullet embedded in its chest? 

To the definitive statement by Dr. McClelland 
(Parkland) that the neck wound was an entry wound . 

Dr. McClelland has declared he sees bullet wounds 
on the average of several times a week and knows 
. the difference between an entry and an exit wound. 
Does the Warren Commission consider Dr. McClelland 
to be either a liar or hopelessly 'excited and 
confused?' Dr. Malcolm Perry (Parkland) also de- 
scribed the neck wound as 'small and neat, an entry 
hole,' quite different from the larger, tearing 
wound made by an exiting bullet. Dr. Perry per- 
formed the tracheotomy which changed the character 
of the neck wound to vhat it was when seen by the 
Bethesda doctors Who also were 'excited and confused' 
if one is to credit the constantly changing contour 
of the reports reliably leaked from 'high sources' 
close to them! 


"Is it possible it is the Warren Commission Which 
Is excited and confused? Can everyone be out of 
step save it? Is it possible that certain sources 
'close to the Warren commission' are finding it

The letterhead memorandum dated 6-3-04, furnished

opinions and ambiguous statements which do not adhere to / 
Bureau standards of reporting. The Bureau has no intention 
of pointing out individual errors. However, a thorough 
review of this communication will readily reveal these 
points. 

It appears Secret Service Hoadquarters has not 
rocelved prior Information relating to Arthur Doffitt. Duo 
to the fact DeWitt has boon described as a "nut”; has been 
hold for a sanity investigation; displayed unusual sympathy 
for Loo Harvey Oswald; indicated his familiarity with riflos 
and has an unsavory background, Socret Service Headquarters 
should bo awaro of him and his activities. Therefore, the 
lottorhead memorandum should contain a predication followed 
by the rosults of tho current investigation and a summary 
of Information relating to previous investigations and 
DoWitt's background. Cnroful consideration should be given

The Bureau is receiving a tremendous volume of ■ 

information which is being furnished to the President’s 
Commission. It cannot be emphasized too greatly the 
necessity for complete reporting and meticulous accuracy 
in communications regarding the assassination, anticipating 
these documents vill be available for possible review. 

In view of the indications that the President's 
Commission is anticipating an early conclusion regarding 
the assassination investigation, Seattle is instructed to 
immediately submit a revised letterhead memorandum to the 
Bureau for dissemination to Secret Service Headquarters 
and revised inserts to Dallas. Careful consideration 
must be given this matter as you will bo held strictly 
accountable for tho forthcoming communication. 

Forward to the Bureau explanations from 
responsible supervisory and investigative personnel 
along with your recommendations for administrative 
action*, for submitting inadequate LHM, 

Dallas is instructed to withhold from report the 
Inserts furnished by Seattle airtel 6-3-64, and incorporate 
the revised Seattle inserts in a report when received. 

NOTE : . 

Off ice received information from 
"The Seattle Times'* who received 
a telephonic adTroft Kay Hopper on behalf of Art DeWitt, 

1108 First Avenue, Seattle. The ad in substance requested 
persons who believed Oswald was innocent in th$ shooting 
of President Kennedy, register at 1108 First Avenue. 

DeWitt's store deals in magazines depicting vaFious 
photographs of nude women and appearing on the store 
window were cut editorials from the "National Guardian" 
regarding the assassination. It appeared DeWitt was 
attempting to capitalize on sensationalism in connection 
with the assassination. Seattle previously indicated 
.that no further investigation was being conducted in 
'this matter and that their indices contained no further ** 
identifying information regarding DeKitt. Bureau files 
were searched and found several references which appeared f ^ 
to be identical with DeWitt not furnished by Seattle but \

was received and reviewed. It contained various errors, 
including opinions, and the phraseology used precluded

FEDERAL llUltEAU OF INVESTIGATION . 

Seattle, Washington 
June 3, 1964 

RE: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT 

JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY. 

NOVEMBER 22, 1963, DALLAS, TEXAS 

Investigation has been conducted by^the Seattle : 

January 6, 1949, reflecting an interview of ' 

Accountant, Atkinson and Jones Company, 

North Richland, Washington, who advised that he operates the 
Tri-City Service Bureau, a small bookkeeping and accounting 
servi ce. He st ated that one of his accounts is the Anchor 
Inn. MHgjBBr advised that f> who works for 

him at^ and Jones CompanyT^^tcniim that the owner of 
the Anchor Inn, ARTHUR DE WITT, approached her when she was ^ 
unemployed and offered her * n * l “ 

mated that she would ha ve to w ^th 

customers. stated that - DE WITT is married to a 

Chinese womar^Jnose^^rst name is MARY and who operates the 
Bamboo Inn, a cafe in Kennewick, . • 

J Investigation also was conducted on May.31, 1952, 

%t ,f which reflected that Mary's Dog House, C and Washington 

Streets, Kennewick, which is owned by ARTHUR DE WITT, is_a , 

small hamburger stand catering to juveniles and the '■’hotfod^- 
set. Chief of Police DUTCH LINCOLN, Kennewick Po lice .Depart- 
advised that there were rumors that DE WITT 

fat this establishment, but LINCOLN had not been able 

to develop specific evidence. 

In July of 1953, as a result of information received ^ 
by the Richland Police Department, MIKE WEST, Juvenile Proba- 
i.tion Officer at Pasco, Washington, advised that he had complaints 
“ one or more dependable juveniles who indicated to him that

On August 29, 1958, information w<

a candidate for Sheriff of Walla Walla County - . . DEWITT 
reportedly had the backing of. numerous "extremists," one of w 
whom is WILLIAM H. HAROLD, who-editfe the Wall* WallaStatesman , 
which is privately printed, and which is anti-communist , anti- 
Semitic, and pro-constitutional party. DE WITT had distributed 
a pamphlet indicating that he *is 'a' candidate for sheriff and 
outlined’ his platform, pointing out that his grandfather arrived 
in Walla Walla in 1863 on an ox team; also that both he and 
his father were born in Walla Walla. The current sheriff and

candidate for re-electjor^^JOHN CUMMINGS, advised that ^ 
DC WITT, FBI Number- has a record dating back to 
March 29, 1934. He TtSufutha t in 1955 DE WITT was held by 
the Sheriff’s Office at Pasco on a sanity investigation. 


On February 18, 1963, Sergeant ROBERT FARNKOFF, 
Kennewick. Folice Department, advised that he received a 
letter addressed to MARY DE WITT, Kennewick, Washington, dated 
February 9, 1963, which she received from EARL ROSTOCK, Emmett, 
Idaho. MARY DE WITT stated that she knew neither EARL ROSTOCK 
nor a TOM DAY, who was referred to in the letter as having a 
large quantity, cf merchandise for sale. Sergeant FARNKOFF 
described MARY DE WITT as Chinese and as working and residing 
at the Bambco Inn, a Chinese restaurant operated by her parents 
at 626 West Columbia, Kennewick, Washington. According to 
Sergeant FARNKOFF, MARY D£ WITT is divorced fqom ARTHUR DE 
WITT, who runs a hamburger stand at Kennewick and who is a 
"nut.” Sergeant FARNKOFF stated that it was possible that 
this letter was some sort of practical joke. 

, 

Investigation has developed that about two months »•<*• 
ago DE WITT closed Mary’s Dog House and opened a shoe shinejy’* 
parlor on West Lewis in Pasco. While in Kennewick V'niost of 
DE V/ITT’s business consisted of selling used, trashy- magazines . , 
and books. Although he is ostensibly in the shoe shine busi- r' 
ness, he continues to have a'back room ,? full of 'cheap* magazines , 
and he reportedly has photographs of nude women for sale. 
Investigation has developed that DE V/ ITT employe/a two girls 
to shine shoes, but that there was little business. 

Investigation at Pasco, Washington, since the latter 
part of November, 1963, reflects that ARTHUR DE WITT plans to 
leave Pasco and go to Florida because he is subject to ridicule 
since he sent flowers to the funeral of LEE HARVEY OSWALD. 

Further investigation reflected - that a rock was thrown through 
his window as a result of his having sent the flowers to 
OSWAID's funeraf. - c -

because OSWALD had r,ct been tried and only conflicting reports 
regarding his guilt had been made. He said if he had known 
with certainty OSWALD had shot the President, he certainly 
would not have sent flowers. DE WITT said that he was cer- 
* tain no one else would send any flowers, so he decided he ' _ ■ 

would. He does not know OSWALD, RUBY, j\ov anyone connected 
with the President's assassination or killing of OSWALD.. _ '...V-'.-.- 

DE WITT was last in Dallas when he hitchhiked through with • ,v 

wife and child in 193S. • -• 

y The floral shop in Kennewick, Washington, which 

•Vsent flowers for DE WiTT advised they telephoned the order to 
t |/Webb Royal Flowers, 166 Webb Royal Shopping Center, Dallas, 
‘/around 9 AM*, November 26, 196 3, and advised they would deliver 
- . a spray to OSWALD'S residence. No message was sent with the 
fjf order. DE WITT said he sends "lots of flowers" to people who 
e might not otherwise get any. The floral shop in Kennewick ;'v 
which sent the flowers stated DE WITT frequently does things 
like this. The Pasco Police Department characterized DE WITT 
as an eccentric and generally regarded as a "nut" by Pasco 
people . 

On May 1U / 1564, 

of the Seattle Times, advised that tne rox lowing advertisemenl 
had been called in by KAY HOPPER for ARTHER DE WITT, a magazine 
store owner at 1108 First Avenue, Seattle, Washington; 

"All persons who believe in LEE OSWALD'S innocence 
in the shooting of President KENNEDY register 
at 1108 First Avenue." 

Investigation at 1108 First Avenue revealed a used

the window which stated, "Where is the Warren Report?" and’’ ' -' If; 
"What Your Newspaper Dares Not Print." . 

On June 1, 1964, investigation at 1108 First Avenue - -- 
reflected that additional printing had been included on the 
window front of the used magazine store reflecting that ARTHUR C. 

DE WITT had left Pasco, Washington, because he had sent flowers 
to the funeral of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, which had resulted in 
someone throwing a rock through the window of his store, causing 
a thousand dollars’ worth of damage to him. Also on the store 
front was printing which challenged the FBI, the CIA, and the 
Secret Service. to develop the truth about the assassination, < 
alleging that ^ these Federal agencies had backed the wrong 
organization in accepting the Dallas Police Department version 
that OSWALD had killed President KENNEDY. DE WITT also had ' 
information on the store front reflecting that he was very 
familiar with bolt action guns and that the angle of the shots 
that hit Governor CONNELLY and President KENNEDY indicated 
that they could not have been fired by a bolt- action gun from 
the sixth floor of the bookstore. DE WITT also had statements 
onthe magazine store stating that the Warren Report was not 
going to be issued in our lifetime. He had a letter from 
the*' Seattle Times'dated in May of 1964, which stated that it 
was not the policy of the* Seattle Times to print the ad requested 
for DE WITT, and DE WITT’s comment was that this indicated that 
the Seattle press was biased and that only the "National Guardian" 
printed the truth.

NOTE : See Mai ley to Rosen memo 6-8-64, captioned 

'•Assassination of. the President," JRM:mpd. Willens of ~ 

the Commission advised that Partridge stated he was at -^ 74 . 

the Western Union Office, 191 South Main Street, Akron, J 

Ohio, and indicated he desired to be protected as he had wi’/ -J r 
information concerning the assassination. Willens v4l. Y1 

requested we check this matter out. The Cleveland Office V 7$ 
was immediately instructed to locate and interview 
Partridge and furnish results to the Bureau. The enclosed | 

LHM from Cincinnati and Cleveland indicates that Partridge w 

is somewhat of an eccentric and quite possibly a fringe mental 
case. When interviewed, he refused to furnish any informa- | 
tion to the FBI and said he would only furnish this infor- : * 

mation to the President's Commission and continually referred X 
to ’’them" and "they" as being involved in "espionage" and t 

placing his life in danger, etc. Since Partridge indicated 
his life was in danger, appropriate local authorities were i 

alerted. ■ . » i

1 ZAPRUDER CAMERA AND FILM , 

Mr. Abraham Zapruder, Dallas, Texas, made photographs 
of the presidential motorcade in an area on Elm Street just 
west of the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets, using a 
Bell & Howell 8 millimeter Zoom lens camera loaded v/ith color 
film. He started photographing the motorcade after it made the 
turn onto Elm Street. He started taking pictures prior to the 
first shot that was fired and continued making pictures until 
the motorcade disappeared to his right. 

He took the film to Jamieson Film Company in Dallas 
for processing and stayed with it during the processing. From

She stated that after hearing the first shot fired she 
panicked and did not take any other pictures. 


From a review of the UPI book "Four Days," 
representatives of the Bureau’ determined that reproductions 
of photographs from motion picture film in this book were

FILM RCVlCW . 


The amateur assassination films taken by 
>!r. Abraham Zapruder, Mr. Orville Mix and Mrs. Marie Much more , / 

including 35 mm color slides made by Life Magazine from the 
original Zap ruder film, were reviewed extensively at the 
Commission by representatives of the Commission, Secret . 
Service and FBI. Doctors who attended the President and 
Governor Connally, wound ballistics experts and Governor and 
Mrs. Connally also reviewed the films on occasions. The film 
reviews were made to establish the location on the film where 
the shots occurred that struck the President and Governor . 

It is noted that only the shot that struck the President in 
the head can be definitely established on all three films. 
Extensive background material was developed, such as the speed 
of the 8 nm cameras used in making the films. To assist in 
the recording of the material developed, each individual frame 
of each motion picture film was assigned a number. The frames 
of the Zapruder film were numbered beginning with 1 at the 
point of the film where the presidential motorcade pictures 
actually begin. This same system was used in numbering the 
Mix and Muchmore films. The 3 5 mm slides we re numbered to 
conform to the frame numbers of the Zapruder film. During 
the film review, all aspects of the films were studied for 
any evidence that would contribute to the location of the 
shots, other than the head shot. Such things as visual 
observations of the reaction of the President and 
Governor Connally, as well as other occupants in the car, 
were considered. Action of Secret Service Agents riding in 
the follow-up car and motorcycle policemen riding behind the 
presidential car were checked for possible evidence.

RE-ENACTMENT* IN DALLAS. TEXAS, ON MAY 24, 1964 



On May 23 and 24, 1964, a survey was made of the ‘ 
assassination site in Dallas, Texas, including a detailed 
re-enactment. SA Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, Laboratory Photographer 
R* E. Triplett and Mr. Roy Rose of the Exhibits Section made a 
preliminary survey on 5/23/64 at which time plans were formulated 
for the method to be followed in re-enacting the assassination 
at which time preliminary information was developed. Since the 
amateur films made by Mr. Zapruder, Mr. Nix and Mrs. Muchmore 
were to be the primary basis on which the re-enactment was to 
be made, it was essential that their exact camera positions be 
developed. The position of Mr. Zapruder was known, since he 
was. on a specific projection of a nearby structure. Since the 
positions of Mr. Mix and Mrs. Muchmore during the filming of 
their pictures were not known, these positions were re-established 
through use of their cameras and photographs made from their 
films. 


.On Sunday, May 24, 1964, the re-enactment was started 
at approximately 6:00 AM. The Commission was represented by 
General Counsel J. Lee Rankin, Norman Redlich and Arlen Specter. 
SA Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, SA R. A. Frazier and Laboratory 
Photographer R. E. Triplett were present from the FBI Laboratory. 
Inspector . Leo J. Gauthier and Mr. Roy Rose were present from 
the Administrative Division and Inspector James R. Mallcy was 
present from the Investigative Division. Inspector Thomas Kelley 
and Agent John Joe Hewlett of Secret Service were present. A 
sufficient number of Dallas Agents were also present to assist 
the above individuals and two-way radio communications were in 
effect from all essential points. 



The Dallas Police Department completely blocked off • j 

the portion. of Elm Street where the assassination occurred. 

Secret Service representatives had available a car closely 
approximating that in which the President was riding and the 
variations between the car used for the re-enactment and the 
President’s car were known and taken into account. Agents of * 

the Dallas Office, who were the approximate sizes of President 
Kennedy and Governor Connally were used in the car to * 

re-establish as. accurately as possible the films of the- - • 

assassination, including positions of the car in the street 


Mary MMell 

' \tiojn 








•> : 

and the positions of the individuals in the car, SA J. Doyle 
Williams was used in Governor Connally*s position and : 

SA James W. Anderton occupied the position of President Kennedy 
in the car. 

SA Frazier was stationed at the sixth floor window 
of the Texas School Book Depository (TSBD) Building with the 
rifle recovered from the building immediately after the 
assassination. It is noted that the presidential car proceeded 
down Main Street to Houston Street, turned right on Houston 
Street toward the TSBD Building and at the corner. of the TSBD 
Building turned left into Elm Street. The assassination 
occurred along Eln Street. The view from the sixth floor 
window of the TSBD Building is partially blocked by a tree for 
a portion of the area of Elm Street. 

The re-enactment was based primarily on the Zapruder 
film and for the purpose of restaging specific frames of the 
Zapruder film a book of black and white photographs of the. 
pertinent frames was available. The first position. established 
was the location of the car in the street at the point where 
the person aiming the rifle would have the last opportunity 
for a clear shot before the car passed under the tree. This 
location was established through the Zapruder film and through 
advice from SA Frazier in the sixth floor window. It has been 
determined that this was frame 161 of the Zapruder film. The 
next location was at a point in the street where there. was a 
clear shot through an opening in the tree. This position. was 
found to be frame 185 of the Zapruder film. The next position, 
located was at a point where there was the first clear shot 
after the car emerged from under the tree and this was frame 
207. Other frames established were based on pertinent frames 
developed during the numerous film reviews that had been made 
at the Commission and they were frames 222, 225, 231, 235, 240, 
249, 255 and 313. Frame 313 is the frame depicting the shot , 
that hit President Kennedy in the head. All of the 
re-establishment of frame numbers after frame 207 were made on 
the basis of the Zapruder film, using known reference points 
in the background of the photographs, except frame 313. This 
frame in the Zapruder film does not have any fixed refei’ence 
points for the establishment of the location, frame 2 4_ of the 




■i r „ 


# ■ « 



Mix film and frame 4 2 of the Muchmore film both depict the shot 
that hit the President in the head and both have fixed reference 
points on which this frame could be re-established. As each 
of the positions was fixed along Elm Street! SA Frazier made 
studies of the possible bullet path at each frame. Measurements 
were also taken and a surveyor calculated the distances from 
the point of the wound in Kennedy*s back to the window and to 
a fixed reference point in the street, as well as the angle to 
the window. In addition, photographs we re made first with 
4" by 5" Polaroid film to check the accuracy against the 
Zapruder photographs, then with 4" by 5" black and white film, 
for permanent record after which the position was photographed 
on 35 mm black and white film, 35 mm color film, and with 
Zapruder*s 8 mm jnotion picture camera on 8 mm color film. After 
frame 313 was established, the car was returned to the corner 
of Houston and Elm Streets v/here it was located in a position 
where there would be the first clear shot after the car turned 
the corner at Houston and Elm Streets. This point was recorded 
photographically with measurements and is referred to as point 
“A," since the Zapruder assassination films do not include this 
portion of the actual assassination route. 

After the fixed positions were determined, the car 
was driven along the route at the previously estimated speed 
of 11 miles per hour of the presidential motorcade and while 
being followed through the riflescope by SA Frazier was 
photographed from the camera positions of Zapruder, Mix and 
Muchmore, using their cameras. This run was re-enacted two 
times • • 

Following the above portion of the re-enactment, 

SA Shaneyfelt and Photographer Triplett went to the sixth floor _ 

window of the TS3D Building and mounted an Arriflex 16 mm motion * 

picture camera behind the telescopic sight of the assassination 
rifle. This was mounted on a tripod and positioned approximately 
in the position believed to have been used by the assassin. The \ 
car was then returned to the corner of Houston and Elm Streets j 

and relocated in the previously determined fixed position and , 

motion pictures were made at each of the points through the 
telescopic sight of the rifle. ; Inspector Leo J. Gauthier 
handled the re-establishment of the car and individuals in the

car as related to the Zapruder film durins this portion of 
the re-enactment. In addition, Itr.Redlich observed the car' 1: r 
from the triple overpass under which the presidential car V’’’ 
traveled immediately after the assassinat ion. Hr, Fedlich 
'found that a shot could be fired from the triple overpass at 
President Kennedy without going through the windshield. After 
the motion pictures were made through the rifle scope of the 
fixed positions on Elm Street, black and white motion pictures 
were made of the car traveling at the estimated 11 miles per 
hour on the assassination route with the scope of the rifle 
and the camera following the car. This was then repeated and 
filmed on color film. 

This concluded the on-sight survey of the assassination 
and the street was again opened to traffic at approximately 

1:00 PM. 

In the afternoon of 5/24/64, studies were made in a 
garage near the assassination site. These studies were made 
to determine the approximate angle of a bullet traveling 
through the President’s neck and through Connally’s chest to 
determine whether or not there was any basis for the theory 
that one shot could have gone through both individuals. This 
angle was re-established based on the Zapruder photographs 
and the known location of the wounds on both Kennedy and 
Connally and was found to be approximately 17°. It is noted 
that the angle from the rifle to the wound in the President’s 
back in the area near frame 222 is also approximately 17°. 
Photographs were made at the garage of the alignment of the 
wounds using a rod to show the wound alignment and a string 
along the wall in the background that had been placed by the 
surveyor at 17°, This concluded the survey in Dallas.

The snced of the presidential car was calculated 
for the area between frames 161 and 313, which is a distance 
of 136.1 feet. This represents 152 frames which are exposed 
at the rate of 18.3 frames per second totaling 8.3 seconds. 
Based on this, it has been calculated that the presidential 
car was traveling at an average speed of 11.2 miles per hour

!• 


From February ?6 to March ? 6 , 1964, Atsuyuki 5*. *33 A, 

a Superintendent of the national Police Agency (hT-\V of Japan, 

visited the United States In behalf of Iil'» agency, primarily 

for the pur;. one of coining information relative to protective 

me.* a urea th*. t v-c-alc? paoI**t Japanese police In prevention of 

assassinations, It being feared that other assassination 

attempts, particularly In Japan where such violence has been 

M3torlcolly prevalent, might follow in the wake of the 

assassination of President John F* Kennedy. 

« • 

A secondary purpose of 5*S3A*9 visit was to meet 
with officials of the FBI nt Washington, D, C., In the hope 
of learning something about the FBI filing system, with «•. view 
toward Improving systems used by Japanese police. 

In preparation for his trip, 3A33A contacted U. 3, 
Treasury Department end U. 3. State Department representatives 
in Japan to arrange visits to U. 3. Secret Service Headquarters 
end various police departments in the U. 3., including New York 
City, District of Columbia, end Belles, Texas., Also, through 
correspondence and liaison, the Director General of the national 
Police Agency of Japan, Mr. Tochlo FOUCUI, made arrangements for 
SA3SA to visit FDI Headquarters strictly for purpose of discussing 
the FEI filing system, it being made clear to the II PA ir» advance 
that the i'h-I was not in a position to discuss any matters whatever 
rslatlvo to the assassination of President Kennedy, or protective 
measures. 

! SASJf, visited FBI Headquarters on March 5, 1964, and 
was given o tour of FBI facilities and an opportunity to discuss 
systems of filing and handling records. :»/,;> J A at that time 
mentioned his other objective in coming to the United Spates,, 
but stated it was perfectly clear to hirr. that the FDI wn3 not in 
a position to mako any information available to him concerning 
the assassination of President Kennedy. • *

> - Shortly of ter hie return to Jnpan from the United 

States, SASSA called at the American Embassy, Tokyo, to ^0^^.-. 
express his appreciation for over-all courtesies he had - ; , 

received. At that tine he commented again that it Has 
entirely understandable to him that the FBI had been unable 
to diocuss with him nny aspects of tho .assassination of 
President Kennedy, but he nnid he hfd tslked to whatever 
extent he could during the visit with representatives of tho 
U, 3, Secret Service, members of the Delias Police Department, 
and newspaper end magazine reporters, as well as reading all , 
public-oourco information available concerning tho incident. 

On June 2, 196ft, SASSA again appeared at the American 
Embassy, Tokyo, Jnpan, to explain that he was shocked to have 
learned that remarks made by him n few we oka earlier in on 
informal discussion which 3A33A had thought was 'off the record' 
had been grossly misconstrued nnd built into a sonsotlonal 
article which wos to appear in the next issue of ' U. S, Tews & 
World Report" magazine. 

• 

S AS3A explained thet on April 2ft, 196ft, he hed been 
invited by Kuniyasu TSUCHIDA, a Senior Superintendent of the 
MPA, to a dinner at the Kokusai Punka Enlkan ('International 
House’ ) in Tokyo, to be attended by a small group of close, 
reliable friends who were interested In hearing about SASSA *3 
recent trip. In all, eight men were present at this party, 
including an American- correspondent by tho none of Glenn 
TROELSTRUP, who came ee the gue3t of a Japanese correspondent. 

SASSA oaid there was some mention of possibility of 
an article being written to refute the so-called '’Buchanan 
theory” which alleged that tho assassination w?3 product of a 
conspiracy between Oswald, Ruby, rnd ultra-rightists in the 
United States, However, it was clearly understood by '**33*., 
T3UC1IIDA, and the Japanece writer that no article would be 
prepared without prior police clearance, and that the discussion 
was thereforo off the record. ‘ Unfortunately, however, both 
SASSA end TSUCHIPA advised nobody specifically stated to the 
group, particularly TR0KL3TP.UP, that anything said should be 
considered off the record,” 

SASSA reported to the American Embassy, Tokyo, that 
when ho learned .about the TROIiLSTRUP article, he immediately 
requested correspondent TR9EI.3TRUP to givo an explanation of 
Inaccuracies in the article, ond of impropriety, in the first 
place# of his having submitted tho article, TP.OKT/jTRUP . ^

subsequently, on June 2 and June 3, 1964, voluntarily signed 
two statements prepared as result of his interviews with 
SASSA, pertinent portions of which are quoted! 

'* * "I# OlemTroelstrup, wish to voluntarily make the ^54? 
following explanation of any inaccuracies appearing 
in the article attributed to me in ’ U. 3. IJevs & 

Vorld Report* magazine of Juno 8* 1964, titled ’Hew* 

Right on the Assassination* A 3ecret Agent*s Story.* 

. '’The entire discussion in which I participated with , 

Mr. Atsuyukl Sasss, Kr. Kuniyaau Tsuchida and others 
on April 1964, at International House, Tokyo, was 
conducted in the Japanese language, in which I do not 
have complete fluency. In all, about eight persons 
were present. Moot contributed comments to the 
discussion, which was carried on in an informal manner 
and lasted for cbout two hours. Of that time, fir. 

Snssa expressed his opinion for at least a tofel of one 
and one-holf hours. I made no notes on anything that 
wao said during the discussion. Immediately. efter, I 
made notes, end on two occasions checked my information 
with a Japanese participant who has proved reliable in 
the past. Then I put together the notes which served as . 
the basis for the Juno 8th article. 

"The article contains a number of statements set forth - 
as direct quotations from Mr. Sosso. Such representation, 
©s pointed out in the statement of yesterday signed by 
Messrs. Sassa and myself and three other Japanese 
participants, contain inaccuracies as in the first place 
cdy the Jopnnese language wao used, and in the second 
place, no notes were taken so os not to interrupt Hr. 
."asso's talk. 

"Title of the article uses the wording ’Secret /gent's 
Story.* The term 'Secret Agent* is the term used by 
myself based on the Journalistic definition. Mr. Sassa 
was introduced os a bona fide official of the Japanese 
police. 

’/gain in the second line of the article appears the 
phraseology, ’secretly assigned* to the FBI investigation. 
This is a Journalistic leader expression drawn by this 
writer from the total content of the discussion. _

"In paragraph 3 tho article dcacrlvoa what may be ^ 
inferred to be the full contents of an official report 'M^y' 
to the Japanese Government# I hove never seen the . ' y-- - 
official report# Mr. Snos© revealed only the information 
gathered from unofficial aourcen in the U# S, 

Column 3» page 3’3# paragraph 1 quotes "ossa aa saying, 

•Veil# the FBI officially timed the ohooting as taking 
piece over six seconds. ##• Kr# Saoaa in making this 
observation explained that his information was based on 
the assassination movie timed and reported by 'Life 1 
magatine, . «»».. . . . " . - .... . ... 

"Page 39# line 2 quotes Snssa as saying# 'So I was sent to 
Join the FPI'.s assassination investigation. ' Sas3n did 
not# in fact, say he was sent to Join the FBI# He said, 
in effect, he had been cent to the United States for the 
purpose of studying overall Presidential-level protection 
procedures. Ho said that the FBI wa3 not responsible 
for the assassination investigation#*' 

"/‘gent Snssa was assigned to study overall security 
measures techniques in the U. 3# end his interest in the 
Kennedy nsoasnlnation was n part of the study. However# 
the Correspondent erred in saying that Agent "as33'o 
'real Assignment 1 was to 'Join 1 the FBI's nssr.oslnation 
investigation. This was not possible because of FBI policy 
which forbids the pgent of a foreign government from such 
participation or receiving concerned official documents. 

Agent Sanaa did receive FBI cooperation in such matters aa 
a study of filing systems , But It was made clear to Mm 
that, concerning tho nssaosination investigation, because 
of specific Presidential orders, he could recolve no 
cooperation. So Agent "aeon's conclusions are baaed en- 
tirely upon unofficial, informal nources. 

Page 39 further ouoteo Snssa »a saying, 'The FBI and 
Bsllao police were concentrating their surveillance on 
none 20 potentially dangerous ultrorightiots. . , ' Sas3« 
mentioned that according to some U. S. publication the 
pollco were concentrating their observation on some 20 
ultrTTrightisto , hr. Snssa made no mention of the FBI ir>- 
this connection. . 

"Page 39/ column 2, quotes Snssa as saying, 'In Washington, 
the FBI poychiotrists noted that Oswald obviously hated his 
father# Mr# Sasso did not refer at any time to 1 FBI — — 
psychiatrists.' What he said was that psychiatrists had 
stated that Oswald hated his father. '"zrrr~ r

More light on President Kenned/s ossassino- 
tion comes from a Japanese agent's report to 
his Government, published here for Ihc first 
time. The agent was assigned to the FBI in- 
vestigation of Ihc Kcnnedy-OswaJd murders 
because the Japanese feared a v/ave of as- 
sassinations in Jopan. Glenn Troclslrup, in the 
Tokyo Bureau of "U. S. News & World Report/'

I, Glenn Troelstrup, wish to voluntarily make tho following ^

titled n llc\t Light on the Assassination* A Secret Agcnt*s Story,**

Atsuyuki Sassa, Kr. Kuniyasu Tsuchida and others on April 24, 

■ • \ _;*• ' 

1964, at International House, Tokyo, was conducted in the Japanese 

&' * 

language, in which I do not have jo.r.p lete fluency. In all, about 

eight persons were present. Most contributed comments to the 

discussion, which was carried on in an informal manner ar.d lasted 

. A > ' . - 

for about two hours. Of that 'tine, Kr. Sassa expressed his opinion 

for at least a total of one and one^half hours. I made no notes on 

■ • . ■ ■ ' /- 

anything that was said during the discussion. Immediately after, 

I made noteu end on two occasions checked my information with a 

Jsnanose participant who lias proved reliable in -the past. Then I

put together the notes which served as the basis for the June 3th

P - \ /" 

Tho article contains a number ofTptato.Ticnts set forth as direct

statement of yesterday signed fry Mes sro^. Sassa ^nd myself and three 

other Japanese participants, _contain v inaccuracies as in the fi rot h

Title of the IPticle uses the wording "Soreet Agent f s Story*” 
The tern "Secret Agent" is the tern used by myself based on the 
Journalistic definition# Mr. Sassa was introduced as a bona fide - 
official of the Japanese Police. 

Again in the second line of the article appears the phraseology, 
"secretly assigned" to the FBI investigation. This is a Journalistic 

leader enpres^ion drawn by this writer from the total content of

the discussion. .*

c ASSASSINATION OP PRESIDENT KENNEDY \ , . *\j 

Mr. DeLoach's attached memorandum, 6/3/64, deals with our con- ^ 
tacts with the press regarding the inaccuracies in captioned article, We xj 
now have additional details from the Legal Attache in Tokyo and have pre- ? ; 
pared a letter to the Warren Commission giving the background in this 
matter. * 

Mr. Atsuyuki Sassa, the Japanese Police Superintendent quoted * 
in the article, has been in regular contact with the Tokyo Office in 1 

I efforts to get this straightened out. We have copies of signed statements 
received by Sassa in which the reporter recognizes and clearly admits his *•; 
error in saying that Sassa was secretly assigned to our investigation and 
in all other remarks about the FBI which the article attributed to Sassa. 

. Sassa did visit the Buroau on March 5* 1964, and was given a 

J special tour and normal courtesies pursuant to earlier approval and based 
! on Legat’s recommendation. lie was told very frankly that we could not . 
i give him inside information regarding the assassination investigation and i 
1 stated the reasons were perfectly clear to him. Ho spent some time 
I reviewing our filing procedures, expressed deep appreciation for courtesies : 
received, and presented a souvenir for the Director. ^ 

This article is actually quite favorable to the Bureau but, by 
misquoting Sassa, makes it appear that he actively participated in our \i 
investigation. We are now giving the Commission the facts to refute this ^ 
erroneous impression.

Legat, Tokyo (80 -6) 


RELATIONS WITH NATIONAL POLICE 

AGENCY OF JAPAN ' 

Remycable 6/2/64. . , 

. As the Bureau is aware, Supt. Atsuyuki SASSA of 
National Police Agency (NPA) of Japan, made an official visit 
to tho United States in early 1964 for dual purpose of visiting 
the Bureau to learn something about the FBI filing system, and 
visiting the U. 5. Secret Service in effort to gain information 
that would assist Japanese police in prevention of assassinations, 
it being feared that other aa3«isoination attempts, particularly 
in Japan, might follow in the wake of the assassination of 
President John F, Kennedy. 

. * • • ’ » ' . 

Eulet 3/16/64 reflects that SASSA visited the Bureau 
on 3/5/64 where he had opportunity to talk with Bureau officials 
concerning FBI records and filing systems. At that time he 
stated it was perfectly clear to him that the Bureau was not 
presently In a position to make any information available to him 
relative to the assassination of President Kennedy. 

Upon his return to Japan, SASSA called at this office 
to thank Legat for tho helpful and instructive treatment with 
respect to tour of the Bureau and discussion of the Bureau* s 
filing system which hod been afforded him. At that time again 
he 3nid he understood perfectly that the Bureau could not dis- 
cuss with him any aspects of the assassination of President 
Kennedy, but ho said he had talked to whatever extent he could 
during the visit with representatives of the U. S. Secret Service, 
members of the Dallas Police Department, and newspaper end maga- 
zine reporters, ns well as reading all public-source information • 
available concerning the incident. 

On 6/2/64 SA33A telephoned Legat advising he was 
flabbergasted to have learned that remarks made by him a few 
weeks earlier in nn informal discussion which SASSA had thought 
was "off the record" had been grossly misconstrued and -built 
into a "sensational'’ article which/t‘6 0 appear in the next i3suo 
of "U. S. News & World Report" magazine. / . ^

SASSA explained that on 4/24/64 he had been invited ' T -v^tr 
by Kuniyaau TSUCHIDA, a Senior Superintendent of the NPA, to / 
a dinner at the Kokusai Punka Koikan (International Cultural * • • 
Institute, commonly referred to as "international House") in ’ ~ 

Tokyo to be attended by a small group of close, reliable friends 
who were interested in hearing about SASSA • a recent trip* In 
oil, eight ren were present ot thi3 party. Including correspondent 
Olenn TROELSTRUP who come as guest of Hldeaki KASE. One of the 
other Japanese participants was also a writer for a magazine, 

SASSA explained, and there was some mention of possibility of 
his preparing an article to refute the so-called "Euchanan 
theory which alleged that the' assassination was product of a 
conspiracy between Oswald, Ruby, and ultra -rightists in the 
United States. However, it wo 3 clearly understood by SASSA, 
T3UCHIDA, and tlie Japanese writer that no article would be 
prepared without prior police clearance, and that the discussion 
was therefore "off the record," Unfortunately, however, both 
SASSA and TSUCHIDA advised Legat, nobody specifically told the 
group, particularly TROELSTRUP, that anything said should be 
considered "off the record," 

On Friday, 5/29/64, SASSA said TROELSTRUP contacted 
him to advise that ho was surprised to have learned that notes 
he hod prepared on the April ?4 discussion had been worked into 
on article which was to bo published by "U.S. Mews & World Report," 
The following day. May 30 , TROELSTRUP showed SA33A a preliminary 
draft of the article, which greatly alarmed SASSA because of 
its impropriety and many Inaccuracies, He requested TROKLSTRUP 
to have the article withdrawn, which TROELSTRUP said ho would 
attempt to do. On 6/2/6 4, SASSA said, ho learned the article 
had actually been printed, 

Legat advised SASSA that if any inaccurate statements 
relating in any w ay to the FPI appeared in the article, It would 
bo absolutely essential to obtain explanation mid retraction from 
the author, S/’SSA said he would do this. 


Later on 6/2/64, SASSA and TSUCHIDA came to this office 
bringing the enclosed statement signed by TROELSTRUP and others. 
They also brought n copy of the 6/3/64 issue of "U. 3, ilews t& 

V'orld Report", from which the article In question was copied and 
is enclosed,

had overlooked his responsibility to make the "off-the-record" 
character of the discussion clear to all participants, and 
since he, os a senior police official was host at the 
gathering and had indicated to SASSA that he could speak 
freely, it was only natural that SASSA would do so. TSUCHTDA 
observed at the same time that actually no sensitive or 
classified matters were mentioned by SASSA, and it was of v 
course impossible to predict at that time that hia remarks - 
would be so grossly misconstrued. 


Legat reviewed the article point by point with 
and TSUCHIDA, ond on basis of their explanations, drew up a 
tentative supplemental statement which they said they would 
ask WOKLTrRUP to sign. Copy of the supplemental statement 
dated 6/3/Gk is enclosed*

the Legal Attache, American Embassy, Tokyo, had given their v/ord i 
to correspondent TROELSTRUP that the statements signed by j 
TROELSTRUP would not be made public. This inaccuracy was pointed 
out to SASSA on 6/9/64 when he furnished Legat the copy, and he | 


assured Legat that he would correct the error in a follow-up 


U 



TROELSTRUP, but Just before SASSA got TROELSTRUP to sign the 
second statement, SASSA telephoned Legat and asked whether this 
office could give TROELSTRUP a statement in writing that the 
statement would be kept confidential. Legat told SASSA that 
this was impossible; that this office could not become involved 
in any way, but that he could give hi3 own assurances to 
TROF.LSTRUP since, as he was aware, statements received officially ’ 
by the P3I arc never used for other than official purposes. 

/ SASSA advised on 6/9/64 that the National Police Agency, 

r . as well as the Japanese Foreign Office, to whom he is to be 
temporarily transferred, i3 completely satisfied with hi3 
current handling of this matter; his record remains clear, and 
he will still receive the special assignment in Kong Kong for ... 
which he had. been earlier slated. I Mx- IC96& Q ~ OafcsC*

RE: PRESTLEY JOHNSON WALTON 


On May 14, 1964, Mr. EDWARD SCHADE, Deputy Clerk, 
United States Supreme Court , made available to an Agent of 
the FBI two letters. Each letter enclosed a magnetic 
recording tape. 

The first letter reads as follows: 

' f '*> * 

"I. Start with tape first. . * 

"I don't know what MrsT^LERNER* s reason was for ordering 
Mr. K and his wife to be move out the cottage before she and 


Mr. LERNER returned that evening.

"Mr. K was next to lady and B I Ll'CRACROFT (?) or 
some* such name was third man and I fourth. 

"As I understood Mrs. LERNER that evening she was 
speaking over (?) her husband head with him President. (?) 

"She gave order for all employees except my self 
to clear out by morning. 

"We were all present standing in the back drive. 

She had very little to say to any one but me. 

"2. I assumed that she had just made he s peach 
to the other men when I came in from walk ( ?7. ' The men were 
all standing there seamily waiting for me. 

"Mrs. LERNER spoke right out saying Mr. WALTON I am 
glad that you are here. 

"We are closeing house for a while I want you to 
take up the call (illegible) close the doors take no 
calls this evening. | / , 

"(BEN) meaning Mpv’'l£RNER and I are going to a 
meeting I'want Mr. K out by the time we get back. We will

"Now due to time I must cut short the story of how 
Mrs. LERNER died before morning. I told BODY KENEDY this 
storyonce and the F.B.I. more than once. 


"After the funeral I went home to Louisville, Ky. f 
and set out to inform (?) the world of what was taking place 
down here in South Florida, i 


"Doctor' FERRY (?) was ready to back me up and I was 
on my way to a meeting with him when he was gunned down. 


"I can not prove that people from Miami w^re behind 
Doctor FERRY*s death, but I say this that DICK/GERSTEIN has 
been playing around with some of the people who suspect 
in the death of the 


/ 


"4. of Mrs. LERNER and the Judge and his wife. 


"he is a good look alike for HENRY-ANNERSON (?)< 


"And I recall that the killer first left the gun, 
and later starting lions (?) (illegible) seen turned 
around and left his hat. later in f ligh droped a jacket- 
I just wounder how they would look on DICK GERSTEIN. 


"I still be that ANNERSON (?) was framed (?) and 
that the same patter fit the J. F. K. slaying.

"I know that the president was pushing Miami off icalls 
around a little to much to suit them. I believe we were (?) 
get clost to something. I had been pushing (?) the president 
and his brother BOBY pretty hard and have good reason to believe 
that they were carrying through on some of the tips' I gave 
them and that migh accout for DICK presence with some of the 
people I suspect. Mr. KENNEDY may have pit him on to them. 

"never the less I don’t intent to take any chances 
on DICE or TOM KELLEY.

3207 S.W. 15 Ave. 

Fort Lauderdale, Florida"* ’* 

A summary of the tape enclosed with this letter is "'-'Ty- 
as follows: 



•> WiStf ,’.i V* 


f 


Re: PRESTLEY JOHNSON V7ALTON 

' ; I t?' V---V i 

The tape begins by WALTON giving his name as PRESTLEY 
J. WALTON, 3207 S.W. 15 Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the 
date as 2/29/64, and is addressed to President JOHNSON. In the 
tape, WALTON says: 

Regarding the threats to the life of the President 
on his visit to Miami, Florida, on 2/28/64, he does not want 
to shake him or be abusive, but has to make the points for 
his protection as he would like to have been able to do for 
the late President KENNEDY. He wants to give some cold facts 
on this matter leading to the assassination of President 
KENNEDY. The people who were responsible for this are friends 
of President JOHNSON, as well as his. "On the surface," he, 
WALTON, is a "crank and a crackpot," running around living in 
every neighborhood and environment that would not be considered 
a decent place for a reputable citizen to live. He lives 
in poverty and docs not make enough to pay incomes taxes, but 
can turn up three million very quickly, probably quicker than 
the President can, and the money will be three million honest 
dollars. . 

He goes back to 1956, right after former President 
EISENHOWER won the election, as the starting point and 
wants to tell about some people who he (presumably the 
President) will scream about and defend, but they are the 
people who are making threats against him. (The "him" referred 
to is not definitely clear). This can be checked with Senator 
JOHN COOPER and began with the murder of Judge CHANNELSWORTH 
(Phonetic) and his wife. WALTON claims to have been meye 
witness to the death of a Mrs. BEN LENEER (phonetic) and knows 
why she died. WALTON was in the employment of the Fairchild 
Funeral Home and took Mr. LENEER' s place when he left to go 
into business for himself. He accuses the people who work 
with President JOHNSON as being murderers, but admits he 
cannot prove it, and he is sure that they were the same 
people who killed President KENNEDY. WALTON says they will 
jcill him because "he has seen them kill." He names BEN 
^TAYLOR, the City Auditor in Miami, and a man by the name of 
BILL..CRAIGCRAFT, or - HUTCHCRAFT , a State Auditor, and indicates 
that the latter probably works for President JOHNSON. 

"■ » } . ■ 

j WALTON then goes back to relate items concerning 

BEN TAYLOR on the missing persons list and states that while’; 
the police were looking for him, TAYLOR was at BEN LENEER' s 
funeral home.' WALTON conthues with disjointed items concerning 
a tape recorder and other equipment slipped into the funeral 
home and the fact that his wife was a fingerprint expert and 
photographer for Cuba.

* He then goes back to mention the CHANNELSWORTH case 

and states the reason for their deaths was the checking of 
the books by BEN TAYLOR and a Federal or State Auditor. 7 

He mentions a suspicious white Cadillac which he was 
told was to be given to President EISENHOWER when he came to 
Miami. Since President EISENHOWER refused to use the car, Mr. 
LENEER took over the car. 

WALTON then relates a disjointed series of items 
concerning someone coming into the dormitory where he slept 
at the funeral home, whom he subsequently identified as BEN 
TAYLOR. He accused TAYLOR of sleeping in a casket in the 
display room. He then gives a disjointed account of how 
former President ‘JOHN F. KENNEDY comes into the case as a 
result of Mr. and Mrs. LENEER* s going to a mass meeting, not 
further identified. He said he told this story to "BOBBY 
KENNEDY" and told him the man to look out for in Miami was 
State '8 Attorney, RICHARQ GERSTEIN, and WALTON is going to 
link him to the assassination of a Dr. TERRY in Louisville, 
Kentucky, and knows he is linked with the CHANNELSWORTH case, 
the TAYLOR case, the death of former President KENNEDY and 
threats against President JOHNSON. 

He then goes on to describe the mass meeting attended 
by Mr. and Mrs. LENEER as being some kind of kangaroo court 
which placed the death sentence on her. He will not go into 
this matter, but Mr. COOPER or "BOBBY KENNEDY" can tell the 
President how she died. 

* It is possible that the "Judge CHANNELSWORTH" referred/ 
to by WALTON is Judge CURTIS EUGENE; CHILLINGSWORTH, West Palm ’ 
Beach, Florida, who together with his. wife, MARJORIE CHILLINGS- 
WORTH, were abducted and murdered June 15, 1955.

"Two local F.B.I. Men were out to talk to me concerning -V 
some printing that I am - havering done at a printing shop down . ' . 
town fort Lauderdale. 

"They were concerned mostly about me useing Mr. 

HOOVER^ and BOBY KENNEDYs Names. 

"I assured them that I am not Just sounding off And 
I had informed you about a year ago that I had some cases 
for you. • 

"To Put Senator MARGARET CHASE^SMITH in the clear of 
any thing I do or say in this election year, I want it under- 
stood That I am backing her* but she is in no way responsible^ 
for any thing I do or say. 

"I keep Her informed on where I stand on political 
issues in about the same manor that I keep in touch with You 
and the news editors . . 

"I dont contend that every thing said in this tape 
recording i<f correct but it is dost enought to tell the 
necessary story. 

"Sincerely Yours, PRESTLEY J. WALTON" 

In the tape enclosed with the above letter, WALTON 
gives the same address and begins with no introductory 
remarks, but it appears the tape is directed to an unknown 
Senator. WALTON states: 

He was visited this week by two FBI agents with 
regard to a petition for Mr. HOOVER’s resignation and in that 
connection, he desired to discuss the Wilmore, Kentucky, 
bank robbery, which happened about five years ago. This is 
not the first case he had reason to investigate J. EDGAR HOOVER 
about. The investigation of the FBI began immediately after 
"Mr. LONG" was kidnapped and run into Texas to be held in a 
mental institution without legal recourse. Checks and balances 
ore needed between the CIA and the FBI. There are lots of 
good criminology students available and they have to remove 
Mr. HOOVER to modify the system. Mr. HOOVER did not use - \' 

road blocks in the Wilmore bank robbery and they should have 
been used. The State airplane was not used and he, WALTON, - ' ■ ; 
was not notified that a bank robbery occurred. The robbers 
Were finally caught by two Quaker preachers and because Mr. 
HOOVER did not charge the robbers with the bank robbery 
offense, he, WALTON, is ashamed of his home town. 1

Re: PRESTLEY JOHNSON V/ALTON 

; " He gives disjointed accounts about his displeasure 

about the issuance of license plates in Tallahassee, Florida, 
and ties this in with the fact that there is no office of 
narcotics agents in Louisville, Kentucky, which is the direct 
fault of Hr. HOOVER. He then mentions a court case being 
prepared to get Mr. HOOVER's resignation, which will be 
handled by men trained in criminology and law. This is also 
mentioned along with the fact that there is a good jail in 
Fayette County, but they do not want to pay for Federal 
prisoners to be kept there. "They” are not further identified. 

WALTON then maligns Attorney General KENNEDY for 
having spent four years trying to get JIMMY HOFFA and finally 
winning a jury tampering case and not realizing he won it. He 
says he would have liked to have seen KENNEDY make the grade 
as an attorney, since he likes the KENNEDY boys, and had 
promised the late JOHN. F. KENNEDY that he would make an 
attorney out of BOBBY ^KENNEDY , but he can see no hope for 
him now. / \ . 

WALTON said that if there is to be any progress in 
law enforcement, we will have to remove Mr. HOOVER from^ 
office. "We have people trained to fill each man’s position 
in the FBI, including Mr. HOOVER’s." More action is needed 
in the FBI and the organization has to be "remodified." 

WALTON states that President JOHNSON has some 
reli^bus conflicts and he has mentioned this to JOHNSON. 

He then says if "we are elected, I won’t be President, but 
I'll be in the Attorney General's office next year and you 
might just as well fece the fact." 

He closes by asking the Senator to whom he addressed 
the tape to take it to Mr. JOHNSON and then to Chief Justice 
WARREN with a request to "let's get this resignation for 
HOOVER started." 

■ t ' ’ 

On May 7, 1964, GEORGE J. ERNST, owner, 
Poinsettia Press, Inc., 325 SW First Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida, advised that he had been contacted by PRESTLEY 
JOHNSON V/ALTON, 3207 SW 15th Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, for the 
purpose of printing up a prospectus on his company, the Space* 
Craft Builders. During the course of contact, he claimed 
Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY was financially interested 
in this company, but had been discouraged from investing 
money in same by J. EDGAR HOOVER, Director of the FBI.

Re: PRESTLEY JOHNSON WALTON 

} : On May 7, 1964, WALTON was interviewed at his 

residence, 3207 SW 15th Avenue, Fort Lauderdale , by Special v.dr* 
Agents of this Bureau. ^ ^ 

WALTON related that he had invented an aircraft 
that was self-powered and could stay in the air for 30 
days without having to land. He exhibited the parts of 
his invention that were obviously not workable. 

WALTON stated that he was having a prospectus 
drawn up on his aircraft. In this connection, he mentioned 
that he had attempted to have Attorney General ROBERT 
KENNEDY invest money in his aircraft, but the Attorney 
General had been discouraged from doing so by J. EDGAR 
HOOVER, Director of the FBI. 

WALTON explained that this was done when Mr. 

HOOVER publicly warned the public against swindlers who 
might entice people into investing and purchasing stock 
in illegitimate ventures, lie was convinced that Mr. HOOVER 
was directing his comments at him, and had discouraged 
individuals, including Mr. KENNEDY, from purchasing stock 
in his aircraft. 

WALTON pointed out that he has written to former 
presidents and the current president, as well as leading 
political figures, concerning his invention and his interest 
in politics. He expressed no animosity towards any of these 

*. people that he referred to. 

WALTON claimed he possessed no firearms, but 
did admit that when he was 17 years of age he was arrested *" 
for malicious shooting in Kentucky. This involved him in 
shooting a Mormon preacher in the foot, the preacher 
having objected to his going with the preacher’s daughter. 

He claimed he served a jail sentence of one year before 
being pardoned by the Governor of Kentucky. He stated the 
gun used in the shooting belonged to his brother. 

The files of the Fort Lauderdale , Florida, Police 
Department reflected that WALTON was f ingaprinted as an 
applicant, Number C4594, on November 21, 1936, in connection,, 
with his employment as a dishwasher. The files contained no 
return which indicated he had nocriminal record with the I' 
Identification Division of the FBI.

At the conclusion of the interview, WALTON stated 
he now realizes that Mr. HOOVER was not personally referring 
to him and he apologized for haing made reference to him. 

He stated that there would be no repetition of this in the 
future. By the same token, he stated he realized that in 
the event he were to have people invest in illegitimate 
schemes proposed by him, he could possibly be subjected to 
criminal prosecution. 

On February 2, 1959, the Louisville Office, FBI, 
received from JOHN NEWMAN, City Editor, "The Louisville Times," 
a daily newspaper of general circulation published at Louis- 
ville, Kentucky, a four-page handwritten letter signed PRESTLY 
J. WALTON, which had been addressed to"Mr. GEORGEBURf, c/o

’Your paper and others have come

"As for the 26 of July Club in

my wife is the daughter of Castros side kick,

On January 4, 1959, PRESTLY JOHNSON^JALTON 
personally called at the Louisville Office of th'e FBI, 
at which time he advised that he resided at 108 East 
St. Catherine Street, Louisville, and was self-employed 
as a "builder, carpenter, inventer, and aeronautic expert." 

WALTON stated that although married to 
DISORa WALTON, a Cuban girl, in June or July 1952 at 
Miami, Florida, he and DISORA did not live together. 

WALTON related that his wife’s employment was 
as Director of Socialized Medicine for Cuban People in 
the United States. As such, he said, she distributed 
medicines and collected thousands of dollars from Cuban 
families in the United States which she sent to Cuba. 

WALTON asserted that ^he knew his wife for only one day 
when he married her in Miami. He was of the opinion 
that prior to that time she had entered the United States 
illegally and had been deported to Cuba. WALTON expressed 
belief that he would hear from his wife soon as he felt 
certain she had fled from Cuba as a result of the revolution 
and would try to contact him for aid. 

WALTON spoke incoherently about Senator EASTLAND 
of Florida and Governor COLLINS of Florida having been in 
league with the Cuban revolt.

Memorandum recommends that 4 documents furnished by 
Legat, Mexico City, to forcier Ambassador Thomas Hann be burnished 
to the President* s Commission per their request* Facts follow* 

In April, 1S64, the Commission sent 3 of its staff members 
to Mexico City, Prior to the trio, they conferred in Washington 
with former Ambassador Thomas Kann (presently Assistant Secretary of 
State)* Following return of Commission representatives from 
Mexico City, the Commission on 4-24-64 requested to be furnished 
with the "dossier" the Bureau previously furnished to Ambassador 
’ illana, We knew of.no dossier furnished to the Ambassador and upon 
jinquiry of Legat, Mexico City, v/e learned that in the early days of 
’'the assassination Ambassador Kann asked to be briefed on the investi 
gation and Legat, feeling that under the circumstances of the moment 
the Ambassador's request could rot logically be declined, furnished 
jhini 4 documents as follows: (1) an undated memorandum on the 

assassination of some 11 pages; (2) an undated momormidum on the 
Jack Ruby investigation of 17 pages; (3) a 12-3-63 memorandum 
prepared by Legat dealing with a complaint of a mental case; and 
(4) a 12-11-63 memorandum by Legat dealing with results of initial 
inquiries by legat and CIA In Mexico City. The material in Items 3 
and 4 have heretofore been furnished to the Commission, 

Items 1 and 2, which have not been furnished to the 
jConnlssion, v/ere work papers prepared in Dallas on 11-25 and 26-63 
ifor briefing purposes. They v/ere also prepared. for use in connection 
with the preparation of the first formal report which v;e made to the 
Commission* Items 1 and 2 vere taken to Mexico City by Supervisor 
Laurence JCeenan who was sent to Mexico in late November to brief the 
Legat and to clearly explain to the Ambassador our position in 
connection with Inquiries being run in Mexico* Items 1 and 2 were 
left by SA Keenan with the Legat. ^ ^ - iQ^QfcO ~

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan 
RE: LEE HARVEY OSWALD 

105-S2555 



The work papers, items 1 and 2, were hurriedly prepared 
during the intense pressures of the Initial stages of our investi- 
gation of the assassination. Prior to utilizing the material therein 
in our formal report and supplemental report to the Commission, 
several factors in these documents were clarified, corrected and*' 
extended; hence, the work papers are now outdated. We believe 
that the numerous reports and memoranda which have been furnished 
to the Commission supersede the information in items 1 and 2, 
with the possible exception of a reference on page 5 of the Ruby 
memorandum to information received from a Chicago source that Ruby 
was previously a close friend of £ Joe Scaramuzzo, a Chicago gun 
shop proprietor, from whose store 3 of the 4 guns used by the 
Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico members in the attempted shooting 
of President Tniman in March, 1S54, were purchased. This information 
appeared on Administrative pages of the 11-30-63 Dallas report in the 
Ruby case and our indices do not show that this information was 
furnished to the Commission in the Oswald or related cases. 

Scaramuzzo has since been interviewed and states that he does not 
know Ruby, has never done any business with him and had never heard 
iof him prior to the shooting of Oswald by Ruby, The President’s 
(Commission is bein" advised of this. 

. Accordingly, in furnishing the 4 documents to the 

Commission, we are also sending copies of the items 1 and 2 to 
Dallas to insure that all information contained in these documents 
is run out and furnished to the Commission in report form. 

On 6-4-64 Liaison Agent Bartlett ascertained from 
William T. Pryce, Staff Assistant to Assistant Secretary Thomas Mann, 
that L'ann did not give or show items 1 and 2 to members of the 
barren Commission. \7e do know, however, that the Commission is 
presently combing State’s files to insure they have received every- 
thing in the possession of State, Accordingly, it is necessary 
that we furnish to the Commission all of the documents Legat gave 
to the former Ambassador. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

(1) Attached for approval is lotter to the Commission 
transmitting the documents in question. As items 1 and 2 were 
work papers and as they are outdated and have been clarified by 
the numerous reports and memoranda furnished to the Commission^ 
letter points out that we would appi*eciate having items 1 and 2 
returned to us if they are of no further use to the Commission.

from Mr. Norman Redllch of the Presidents Commission on * v 
June 10, 1064. Mr. Redllch, requested this Bureau to attempt to ’t.

On June 16, 1964, /gents of our Dallas Office interviewed 
Mr. Eddy Barker, News Manager, Station KRLD TV -Radio, Dallas,;'- 
Texas. Mr. Barker recalled that Adlal Stevenson gave a speech In ^jf ‘ 
-.JDuilas on the night of October 24, 1963. The following day, one of 
General "Walker’s aides, Identity presently unrecalled, called :* : 
a Mr. Barker and advised him that General Walker was flying three L 
i American flags upside down In front of his house. This aide indicated ' 

It that tl»ls was being done because ’’Dallas was a city in distress. w , . $*

AbSwrS’ 

Dafes: 


I T HAS always socnird to be that the conspiracy 
theory of history makes its strongest appeal to the 
v.cik-mirxH. I refuse to believe that some plumed 
and bolted early wrote Shakespeare's plays. I decline to 
accept that gypsy cror.c, who calls herself Anastasia, 
.as the daughter of the Czar. 

I Such notions are, of courser revealed truth to people 
|who know there are hordes of Communists In the State De* 
jpartmrnt and armadas of fjyhf pu^rs Out There. I ail 
in the Coptic* comer. That's why I am astonished to find 
myself somewhat troubled by the recent spate of writing 
I tiere and abroad, aucnesUfi;! that Lre IVartvy Oswald may 
fcol have be^*n the assassin of President Kcnmd’d 
I These writings. let ir*e say quickly, are not! conclusive 
In any stnsc. But they do cast certain doubts on the official 
Vase against Oswald. 

V *A rirjitiatic pl*vc of m Iduire— a^aln, liunnt tihire — was 
the ph«»U*jiaph reproduced In the weekend papers. Taken 
at the very Vu.-ds-.nl the JVeslrlent lurched forward In Ids ear. 
the pliuto showed a dimly familiar figure In Uie doorway of 
the Texas St ho ilLook Depository. Enlarged several times 
the figure bears a marked resemblance to Oswald. Was II 
he? IT so, how ctntld he have been, at the same moment. |!f 

f lights above the street firing a rifle? 

If we are to believe the F3I, the man In the dooiway 
• war another employee of the depository', a man who le'olcrs 
4 Jn the name Billy Loveledy. 

From the day of the assassination, a con*:dciable body 
of opinion In Europe has Inclined towaid the conspiracy - 
theory. One of the most talked about b^cks in England is 
•'V.’Jio kill's! Kennedy?- by an American expatriate, Thomas 
| Buchanan. 

Bjchanan’s main theses arc rot new. But they remind 
[one a^ain cf how very touchy the FBI has been In ks brief, 
almost noncommittal replies to the Inevitable questions. 

• Because there were five bullets (Buchanan Insists) and 
1 tccause one apparently entered Kennedy’s throat from the 
1 front, he feels there must ha\e been two assassins. 

* Buchanan & conclusion: Right-wing, oil-rich Dallas hired 
left-win;*, dirt -poor Oswald to do the awful deed, then sup- 
‘ pllodj_£seond killer In case Oswald weakened or missed the 
,tsss*w_^ -• ..

Jtn referring to historical writings In general she states she is a skeptic and refers 
to some of the recent news stories about Lee Harvey Oswald and the doubt that has 
been expressed by some that he is the assassin. Miss Van Horne refers to the 
- rumors and erroneous stories already discredited by the FBI such as the recently 
released photograph allegedly showing an individual who resembled Oswald in.the vr 
doorway of the Texas Schoolbook Depository at the time President Kennedy was shot; 3 
there were five bullets involved in the assassination, some of the shots coming from 
in front of President Kennedy; Oswald was working as an informant for the FBL 
Miss Van Horne claims these questions will be argued by historians for years and 
refers to the ineptitudes of the Dallas Police Department and the Secret Service and tfcje 
•'arrogant, above-the-fray attitude of the FBL In a democracy there is no place for o

-Bureau files reveal only three references to Miss Van HornelJ In 1958 ? 
one of her television columns referred to the television Industry’s efforts to Improve i 
television programs. In connection with violence on television she referred to typical t 
letters she had received from TV viewers one of whom referred to the Director as . . 
stating that some types of television programs are unhealthy entertainment and a —?- 
contributing factor to juvenile delinquency. ,The two other references deal with her 
name being mentioned during our investigation of subjects of Bureau cases who v ' 
referred to her radio or television column but there was no indication that Harriet Van 
Horne was associated with these individuals^ . . ... . — . : V- *

President Kennedy* s successor, President Johnson, might hold nearly tne^ 
same views on civil rights and foreign policy matters as Prcsident^^ 
Kennedy, President Johnson had been chosen by them to succeed the late - 
Speaker San Rayburn to defend their interests in Washington, Buchanan; 
states that it would be fantastic if President Johnson was in any way -.• 
involved in the plot to kill President Kennedy. He further states that 
no such implication is intended, . ..;J y 


Buchanan alleges that a Texas millionaire identified only as ; 

"Mr. X" was the author of the plot to kill President Kennedy. "Mr. XT ; 

supposedly had three enemies* 1. The Italian oil magnate Enrico Mattel 
whose extensive business holdings and undercutting of American oil .*/.:/• 
prices upset "Mr. X"; 2. President Kennedy; and 3. Soviet Premier 
Khrushchev. All of these men, according to Buchanan, stood between - ?v ' 
"Mr. X* and world domination. Buchanan implies that "Mr. X" could have 
been behind the airplane crash in October, 1962, in which Mattel was 
killed in Italy. He states that "Mr. X," by having President Kennedy^ ; 
assassinated, would not only get "rid or" him, but would also discredit 
Khrushchev by having everything point to-the fact that Oswald was a . * — — - 
communist who had been trained in Russia, To prevent Oswald froo - 
revealing anything about the authors and plans of the conspiracy, he was, 
according to Buchanan, to be killed before capture. Since this was not 
done, then it was necessary for the conspirators to arrange for him to 
be killed before being brougnt to trial, •"////.';' -r': 

, _ B UCHANAN VERSION ; ;-/ • . : • .* ;• - ; V /' 

' % Buchanan sets forth his version of the way the assassination 

l was carried out by seven individuals working for "Mr. X." Id/- 
I introducing his version, Buchanan admits that he is dealing with the - . 
I realm of speculation ana that all the elements of his hypothesis, some 
I of which may be incorrect in detail, are based on probabilities. 

This approach by Buchanan shows the weakness already attributed to him 
by responsible reviewers of his writings about the- assassination of ; 
President Kennedy, Buchanan, as well as others who oppose Os\vald*s / 
guilt as the sole assassin, admittedly are basing their case on: 1. t 

reports in the press which during the early days after the assassination 
were confused and contradictory; 2, false and vicious rumors and 
hoaxes which have been fostered by irresponsible public officials as well 
as by individuals: 3. motives which could be monetary; and 4, views _ 
which represent tneir economic, political, and social thinking. It 
would be* surprising, indeed, ir Buchanan with his communist background 

idid not disclaim Oswald as a real communist and claim that he was — ; 

J instead a double agent working or to be working in the future against 

—communist causes. In addition, commentators such as Buchanan are — — —

According to Buchanan, there were 2 assassins# ; ; ; : 

fired one shot from the railway overpass in front of the President's'^- ^ 
motorcade and fled, leaving his murder weapon on that bridge. Assassin jz 
who had been hidden in the TSBD between closing tine the night before 
and opening on the morning of the assassination, fired 3 shots with a, .- 
weapon brought to him by Oswald or some other person working in the J r ! 
building, ilis 3 shots had three purposes: to accomplish the -<>- i 

assassination of the President if Assassin 1 could not carry out hi Si * 
mission; to act as a diversion to permit the escape of Assassin 1; ’ 

ar.d to show some shots came from the building where Oswald had been ‘ i 
working so that he could be caught as the scapegoat in the plot. •iywV. - 
Assassin 2 probably escaped the TSBD dressed as a policeman.; 

Oswald, according to Buchanan, was Accomolice_3 . He purchased 
the rifle for the plot, guided Assassin 2 into the TS3D and the stockroom 
brought him the rifle, and immediately after the assassination, was founc 
on the second floor of the TSBD. Thereafter, Oswald was permitted to 
leave the building in violation of police orders. • '■ ;

not ever managed to secure the favour of the officers above liim. , ^~-- ~

BUCHANAN 




Buchanan states that the "official* theses which he sets forth ; 
on the assassination will be those on which the police of Dallas and the ; 
FBI appear to be in general agreement. He also states th his analysis r 
of then is not based on mere press speculations but on the official ; 

sources, 'That he rails to mention is that his analysis actually ~~i 
speculates on what has been reported to have been said by the police of 
Dallas and the FBI, ' . • - - vr--; - -

Buchanan states that the "official* thesis is that the* * 

shots fired at the presidential car came from one direction, a lone ~ . : 
assassin in the 6tli floor window of the TSBD. I!e says he doubts this . . 
because the doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas first*-.?* ; 
reported the wound in President Kennedy* s throat as an entrance wound 
indicating the bullet came from in front of the motorcade, but were later 
talked into changing their report on the wound after the autopsy at 
Bethcsda Naval Hospital reported the wound in the throat was an exit-type 
wound. Doctors at Parkland Hospital have stated that their main - 
purpose was to sustain life and not to closely examine the sources of • 
wounds and the paths of projectiles inside the Presidents body.;^-* 

Buchanan states some witnesses reacted as if the shots had 
come from in front of the motorcade. In our inquiries there were * 
several who said this, but numerous others have said they believe the 
shots came from behind the President, *•-- --V. i * . .. 

1 / ' * Buchanan also, in his effort to show the 'shots came from * 
in front of the President, states that an assassin could have been on 
the railway overpass in front of the motorcade since the overpass was 
unguarded on that day, Buchanan either is lying deliberately or docs 
not know the facts: there was a police guard on the railway overpass 

and he, aloti£ with several civilian witnesses also on that bridge, denied 
seeing anything to indicate an assassin fired a weapon from the bridge.

President Kennedy* s back by doctors, at Parkland Hospital although the " 
autopsy at Bethcsda Naval Hospital claims that there was such a wound7

RE: . "KlIO -KILLED KEN1IEDW" V | 

Kc states it hard to believe that doctors at Parkland failed to discover 
the wound in spite of the staten-.ent by those doctors that the reason i . : . » 
they did not notice it was because President Kennedy was lying on his.'* 
back during their life-saving of forts. He implies that the wound was]’- i 
invented to prove all the shots ctune from behind.--

i ^ Buchanan claims that tlio second ’’official” thesis is that * 

I the marksman who fired all the shots ves OsVald. He claims that an v 
iir/estigator for the Presidents C>i mission informed him that if more, 
than three shots are conclusively established, it may be assumed that- - 
there were two assassins. This is so because the investigator stated' 
that no nan could have fired four shots in the 5 to 6 seconds. He , 
claims that a news story shortly after the assassination claimed a- ; £> .* 
s:tall round bullet bole in the windshield of tho President’s car.^'v- * 
What Buchanan fails to state is that the newsman later said the glass 
splintering could have been caused b7 a ricochet from inside the car. 
Laboratory examination of the wind-shield showed that it was cracked by ; 
a projectile from behind. * - ; . * -.. > -

Buchanan claims that Or wmld’s Marine Corps record for '; 
marksmanship shows that he was one of the worst shots in the Marines • 
or in any other military service and could not have been the successful 
assassin based on his past record,. This seems hard to accept since 
Oswald was rated in the ’’sharpshooter” clas3 which even Buchanan admits 
is the intermediate class betv/eon tho top class, ’’expert,*’ and the ., 
‘bottom class-, ’’marksman.” * .. * 

• - - •" •' - Buchanan states that the third ’’official** thesis is that 

police have proved by scientific evidence that Oswald fired the murder 
weapon. He states that the FBI has denied that palm prints were found 
on the rifle used in tho assassination. Ko such statement has been 
made by a representative of this Bureau. The truth is that a latent 
print lifted from the rifle barrel was identified by the Identification 
Division as tho right palm print of Oswald* j 

Buchanan claims that the paraffin test made on Oswald’s har 
and .check by the Dallas FD after arrest revealed that he bad powder, 
residues on his hands but none on bis check. This means, Buchanan 
claims, that Oswald may have fired tho pistol said to have been used 
in the killing of Police Officer Tippit, but that tho absence of powder 
I on his cheek shows ho did not fire tho assassination rifle since there 
would have been gunpowdo.* residues on his right cheek,. Buchanan does 
not tell all about tho paraffin test. It is regarded as unreliable and 
inconclusive. Evidence by Bureau experts has been given to the ; 

I Commission already to that effect. • 7 *

Buchanan states that the -fcucth "official" thesis is

I workers went to the street to see the President, ana that after they^. 
! had left, he went into the stockroom and remained alone there* v He/ -pr;>

• of the 6th floor reportedly taken about the assassination time. It ; '

after the assassination Oswald hid the rifle, descended to the ^ 


second floor lunchroom, took out a bottle from the automatic drink 
dispenser and began to drink it before the TSI1D superintendent, Roy S, 
Truly, and a policeman reached the second floor in checking out the j 
building, Buchanan alleges that Oswald must have been the "fastest : ' 
runner since the great Olympic title holder t Jesse Owen s," to have ' 
done all the above before Truly aid the policeman arrived on the .~ v. 
sccond floor. Truly has advised tiiat he saw Oswald on the second /?';•/' 
floor of the building in about two or three minutes after the . 
assassination, A survey was made by Bureau Agents to determine the • 
times taken using various router, ind rates of speed to arrive at the 
first floor from the assassination window on the 6th floor. The j 
I longest normal time period was just over three and a half minutes, 


ACCORDING™ mjCWAUAN: 





* Buchanan alleges that the assassination of President Kennedy 
was not a communist plot in spite of Oswald's past defection to the. 
Soviet Union end his pro-Castro activities in the months prior to 

• the assassination. He claims that the Soviet communists could not 

~ have gained in their efforts to aid world peace by having President 

] Kennedy killed. Such a move wo*. Id have hurt peace efforts by the 

i Soviets, He claims that Castro Cuba would not have gained either since 
a campaign was underway both by Kennedy and Castro to relieve the . 

• tensions between Cuba and the U.S, As for the Chinese Communists,* 
Buchanan claims they too would have gained nothing from the assassination 

: since President Kennedy hod reportedly said that he did not think -

Buchanan devotes 40 out cf 192 pages of his book to a'i'XXv..- 
discussion of the assassinations of President Lincoln in 1865r ^ ; XXV .- : 
President Garfield in 1881, and President McKinley in 1901 and the V. * 
implication of the assassins in various conspiracies. lie uses this ■ 
approach to claim that the 3 assassinations were the result of v ' 
conspiracies or beneficial to opponents of the 3 assassinated Presidents 
and thus history shows that the pattern of conspiracy in the past • 
was, therefore, present in the assassination of President Kennedy in 1962

% In Buchanan’s article in "L’JL'rpress* of 4-9-64, Buchanan set 
forth his versier of the conspiracy- to kill President Kennedy and LV. 
stated that leading the wealthy oilman behind the conspiracy was a ' 
‘Hr, II.* Buchanan, it is noted, openly mentioned in the article that 
Mr. II. L. Hunt ./~s one of the wealthy men in Dallas, and while he did 
not specify thac Ur. K. L. Hunt was the "Mr. H" behind the conspiracy, 
Buchanan certainly made that inference. -In his book *V»T.o Killed 
Kennedy?” Buchanan omits any mention of Mr. Hunt by name and has 
changed the author of the conspiracy from "Mr. K" to "Hr. X." Y/hat 
Buchanan had in mind in making the change is not -known. However, it i 4 
possible to offer conjecture that he wanted to avoid possible libel 
suits in connection with the book. . - '

• Reference Mr. Jones* memorandum to me dated 5-27-64 in captioned 

matter. Harriet Van Home, in referring to the Kennedy assassination, mentions - 
several specific questions that she believes will be argued by historians for years, i 
She referred to the ineptitudes of the Dallas Police Department, the Secret Service 
and the ’’arrogant, above-the-tray attitude of the FBL" She added, "In a democracy 
there is no place for ’secret police, \ however holy their reputation. " R was j 

recommended that I talk with Walkefj$tone, Chief Editorjof the Scripps-Howard^. 
Newspapers, regarding this woman. 1 ^ : \ \^ ' T/.C^ • '■ 

, I talked with Walker about this matter on 6-3-64. I told him it seeme 

rather strange to see one of the Scripps- Howard columnists taking off against the •

get in touch with his New York Office and have this woman set straight

’’On the 2*Jth of Hay, 1^64 there had appeared ln ^- : > r ' 
the Cleve. Sunday Plain Dealer an article that was 
resultant of an Interview by a reporter with Cleve ; 
esteemed police chief. The article dealt with the 
precautions they v;lll take to Insure the safety of 
those esteemed officials taking part in the forth-^^^^-^^.V 
coming Gov. convention June 6-10. There wa3 a line 
or two as pertained to fanatics, and then there was/ZU^//: • 
a line a3 stated that there is a Lee Harvey Oswald -/ 

in Cleve. and who was designated as the L.H.O. of 
Cleve. According to the quote of the police chief /':.^v •->*./ 
this 'fanatic' had been investigated by the F.B.I., 'M ?;?/*//' 
though he didn't mention the results of the investi-^^/^/--

the letters for several months and then, not hearing further 
from Krochmal, threw them away. .

Krochmal stating that they had been destroyed because they '

institute an investigation on the basis of the salary still ' .t r-

that Hary^Kozak, 23*19 West 5th Street, Cleveland, Ohio, who ■;

for her injuries from the Government plus wages, and that all 
other employees of the company receive wages due them. At the

President concerning the rights of all concerned In this matter

a Mr* 


f The Director has agreed to ncet Mr. Arai at 10:15 a.m.;~ 

1 tomorrow”, 6-1G-64. . The recent M U. S. News and World Report" -• 
article which incorrectly quoted NPA Superintendent, Atsuyaki Sassa, 
concerning the nature of his Bureau visit earlier this year, may - 
be mentioned by Mr. Aral. , , - 

. 1^ v - * : 

Our 6-9-64 ncmorandum/CSptioncd, "U. S. News arid World • 
Report Article 6-8-64, Regarding - Assassination of President Kennedy^, 
temporarily attached, points out tfic*t'rue facts' regarding Sassa*S~ 
jvisit and that the author of the article has recognized and ^ ' 
admitted his error in saying that Sassa was secretly assigned to 
our investigation and in all other remarks about the Bureau which ':, 
the article attributed to Sassa. ... , V'/l-.-. 

• ■* 

1 A current letter from Tokyo, 6-IO-64, points out that ~ . 

"U. S. News and World Report" has printed a clarification of the 
earlier article. We know that Deputy Director Arai has been : 
keeping posted on developments in this matter and is said to be ' . . 

quite disturbed regarding the inaccuracies in the article. We 
therefore believe it very probable that he will mention this 
natter during his conversation with Mr. Hoover and express regrets 
that such a misunderstanding occurred after one of his subordinates . 
.visited the Bureau. It appears that Superintendent Sassa, working 
jclosdly with the Tokyo Office, did take all the possible measures . 

| to set the record straight and was most apologetic about the whole 
•affair. The facts, including copies of the reporter^ admissions 
concerning errors in the article, were sent to the Warren Commission

of the film speeds of the cameras to the elapsed times between various Q 
frames of the films depicting the assassination. He also explained the Q 
manner in which frame numbers were assigned to each frame of each of the o 
assassination films for convenience in the study of the films. In tq 

addition he testified regarding the numerous reviews of the motion pictuigs 
films that have taken place at the Commission, individuals present at £ 

these reviews and, in general, the purpose of the film reviews, which 
was to try to establish the specific points in the films where shots 
occurred.

Memorandum to Mr. Conrad - 

Re: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY 

62-109060 


■ ;^vv:U- ,vr: • 


stated the members of the Commission, FBI and Secret Service that 
were present at the re-enactment and the manner in which the car and 
its occupants were established at locations on the assassination 
route based on specific frames of the Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore film.s 
and observations ox SA Frazier from the sixth floor window of the ... ■; 

Texas School Book Depository (TSbD) building. The specific frames of 
the Zapruder film used for the re-enactment were. A, 161, 166, 18S, .. 

186, 207, 210, 222, 225, 231, 235, 240, 249, 255 and 313. He testified 
regarding photographs that were made of the re-enactment at each of 
the specified points along the assassination route as well as motion _ 
pictures made of the re-enactment car moving along the assassination 
route. Exhibits had been prepared for each of the frame numbers 
re-enacted and each exhibit contained a copy of a Zapruder photograph, 
a corresponding copy of a re-enactment photograph, a photograph taken 
through the scope of the rifle and a listing of the measurements 
related to that location including distance and angle to the window 
of the TSBD building and distance and angle to a nearby triple over- 
pass. He further testified regarding the motion picture film that was 
taken through the telescopic sight of the rifle, of the car both in the 
fixed location previously determined and during the time the car drove 
the assassination route at approximately eleven miles per hour. 

SA Shaneyfelt also testified regarding his examination of the Zapruder 
film including reaction or lack of reaction in either President Kennedy 
or Governor Connally at various points in the film. He also testified 
that he had established as a result of the survey and a further study 
of the Zapruder film that the assassination car was traveling at an 
average speed of 11,2 miles per hour during the pertinent portion of 
this film. All of the exhibits presented by SA Shaneyfelt regarding 
the re-enactment were admitted in evidence. . . 

SA Frazier testified that he participated in the on-site 
re-enactment, making observations from the sixth floor window of the 
TSBD BUILDING. In this connection, the Commission desired to jplace 
the car used in the re-enactment at the point where the assassin would 
have his last clear shot before the car passed under a tree which over- 
hangs Elm Street in front of the .TSBD. The Commission wished to determine 




also if the assassin would have a clear shot at the President through 
any break in the foliage of this tree and to position the car where 
the first clear shot could be made after the car emerged from under 
the tree. SA Frazier, using the telescopic sight on the assassination 
rifle, fixed these positions as frame number 166 (last clear shot), 
frame number 186 (snot through opening in tree) and frame number 210 
(first clear shot beyond tree) of the Zapruder film and so testified. 

SA Frazier also testified that under certain hypothetical' 
conditions set out by the Commission (in particular that there was no 
deflection of the bullet while passing through the Presidents body), 
and under the conditions shown in the photographs taken during the on- 
site re-enactment, a bullet which struck President Kennedy in the back 
of the neck (first wound) would necessarily have struck the car or its 
occupants after exiting from the front of the President’s neck. This 
condition exists due to the downward angle of the path of the bullet 
and to the position of the Presidential limousine which was moving 
virtually directly away from the assassin’s position. 

Under the hypothetical conditions set out by the Commission, 
(in particular that there was no deflection of the bullet while passing 
through the President and that Governor Connally was sitting in front 
of the President approximately as the scene was reconstructed on 
S/24/64), SA Frazier testified that it was possible the bullet which 
wounded the President also could have struck Governor Connally in the - 
back and passed through his body. ......... . 

However, in connection with all of SA Frazier’s testimony 
concerning hypothetical questions and assumed conditions, SA Frazier 
was careful to inform the Commission that there was insufficient 
technical evidence known personally to him to support or otherwise 
resolve the hypotheses and assumed conditions advanced by the 
Commission representatives. 


Following the testimony of Messrs. Kelley, Gauthier, Frazier 
and Shaneyfelt, movie films made by SA Shaneyfelt at the re-enactment 
scene were shown to the Commission and made a part of the Commission's

PURPOSE 

— '-r " * - 1 - 


To recommend the attached letter transmitting a 1266 page 
tiDallas report, relating to allegations against persons other than Oswald, 
jibe sent to the President's Commission and to recommend copies of this 
II report be also disseminated to Secret Service and the Department, 

BACKGROUND 

Immediately after the assassination we started to receive 
complaints relating to individuals other than Lee Harvey Oswald, These 
complaints generally relate to remarks and threats allegedly made by 
individuals concerning their feelings about President Kennedy, other 
officials and the policies of the administration. These complaints are 
received from persons not involved in subversive activities such as 
I cranks, mental incompetents and sincere individuals believing it is 
I their patriotic duty to report suspicious activities, statements, etc. 
Some of these people pose a possible threat to the President and 
consequently, we have sent copies of prior reports to Secret Service // 
which results in still additional names being placed in the files of^> 
that service, 'These complaints continue to be received by the Bureau' 
and other agencies both local and Federal, who in turn refer them to 
us tor action. 

Where threats have been received against the Attorney General 
or other high officials, the Department has been advised or other 
appropriate dissemination made. 


\ 


DETAILS 

The current report consists of 1266 pages and is divided into 
five volumes. It contains investigative results from all over the 
country and wns assembled by our Dallas Office who is coordinating this 
project. The assembling of a report of this size is a tremendous under- 
taking and requires a great deal of Agent ‘and steno time. This report 


has been reviewed by Mr. Belmont; Mr. Malley and Bureau supervisory 
personnel and took an estimated forty hours to qomplete the review. te .

thai on 6-2-64, he obtained 50 one dollar bills from the University- 
Siate Bank and that on 6-13-64, be noticed that three bills^er©^^/, ; 
defaced and one bad the hand printed legend "Help! 

Kennedy will be shot Nov 22, 1963 warn him please!" Stephenson 
had no information regarding the source of these bills. ; ; : 

While it would appear that this is some type of pranks - • 
nevertheless, the bills are being examined by the Laboratory / 

It is felt we. should make inquiry at the University State Bank -.'^y 
in an effort to learn more about the bills. When the results . f 
,of all investigation are completed, Houston will submit' an 1 >:. 

appropriate letterhead memorandum for dissemination to the* v v ^.y fc *

NOTH 


It is noted that the Commission letter suggests 
the possibility of identifying the automobile, in 
one cf the photographs through interview with General 
Walker. Dallas oirtcl 6/25/64 states tftat Walker 
is a very controversial figure and any contact with .r 
him would undoubtedly cause him to alert the press VT 
media concerning the nature of the inquiries. Dallas - 
recommends that Walker net be interviewed since their ✓ 
invest igo t ion has resulted in information that the),. 
_outoinobi lc most likely is the car of one Charles F : . 
Kilhr who is a frequent visitor to the Walker residence

Dear Mr. Hoover: 


* We note that one of the photographs pur- 
porting to depict the house of Major General Edwin.— 
A.~"Walker, which photograph has been marked as 
Commission Exhibit 5 and as FBI inventory number 
369, has been mutilated in such a way as to obliterate J ^ 
the license number of an automobile which appears ii i 
the photograph. Would you please advise concerning, 
the circumstances under v/hich and from whom your 
Bureau obtained the above photograph and as to whethe 
or not the picture was so mutilated at the time it came 
into your possession or into the possession of any 
! other person or organization from whom you may 
1 have obtained it. 


! We would also appreciate having the 

t automobile in question Identified. Since the photograph 
'• purports to depict General Walker* s house, the General 
could probably identify the automobile, as well as the

We also note that the photograph • ^ ' 

appears to have traces of Ink or some similar sub- ' 
stance on its face* Would you please advise <..• 
whether or not such substance was on the photograph 
when you received it and, if not, how it came to be 
on the photograph* 


The photograph in question depicts several • 
trees and shrubs, which do not appear to have any 
leaves on them. We note that pictures taken in the 
vicinity of General Walker’s house by the Dallas Police 
Department on April 10, 1963 show some of the same 
shrubs wluch appear to be well covered with leaves* 

Could you advise as to the approximate date on which . ;V 
Commission Exlubit 5 was taken by examination of 
the condition of the trees and shrubs shown in that 
picture. 


For your possible assistance we enclose 
the two photographs mentioned as having been taken by 
the Dallas Police Department, which have been marked, 
respectively, "A M and"F". Would you please return 
them after they have served your purposes. 

Could you advise, on the basis of the 
shadows appearing in Commission Exhibit 5 as to the 
approximate time of day at which it was taken* 

On the basis of the interview set forth at 
page 439 of the report of Special Agent Robert P. Gember-

cleaning the seat pockets of a Braniff plane* ; , 

The typewritten letter was dated May 22, 1964, 
and directed to one "Don Janson" from "8* Martin", It ; 

showed no address for sender or receiver and was without 
envelope. It was pointed out by Mr, Manchester that the letter 
could have been left in the plane on any of many previous 
flights. , 

The letter from 8, Martin to Don Janson refers to 
in quotes comments of a "Texas reporter", who was described as 
"a proud and eager friend of that police force of the year 
in Dallas", It noted that "Vicki" took notes on the interview 
and that he, Martin, had five hours of recorded conversation 
with the reporter, whose comments were reported as follows: 

"For Cod's sake, don't tell the FBI, but back about 
. February (1963) when I was working for H, L, 

Hunt, some very prominent Texas men, H. D, Matthews 
and I discussed the possibility of doing away with 
Cheddi Jagan or Castro or both* Not by the U.S. 
government, you understand, but on a private basis; 

Hunt eaid we could have all the cash we needed, the 
others were in it, too, on a cash basis. Wo 
were going to get Castro sometime when he (Castro) 
went to Mexico, Understand now, we dropped it, 

R«D, didn't go for it, I didn't go for it. Meanwhile, 
wo understood there was a group in Florida with the same 
idea. Also, the government knew all about it," ■ 

• . . . . . 

, (Our question:) Which branch of the government knew 
all about it? . «?

Assistant AG Miller by letter dated -6-8-64, received >■ 
6-10-04, furnished Zeysegg’s letter for information. There •? 4 ’< 
is no indication the Department has acknowledged Zeysegg *s . 
letter, therefore, there is no reason for the Bureau to f ,\ v ^' / 
acknowledge it. Zeysegg indicated he is a foreign stampVv;: . 

collector and an exchange partner in Czechoslovakia sent a ' 
’'stamp-letter" enclosing a ’’clipping’’ from a Czchoslovakian ' ^ . 

newspaper revealing President Kennedy’s photograph; with^the J^ '^;-' 
caption ’’This Man is Wanted for Treason, ” Zeysegg sent; this 
photo to Senator Kenneth B. Keating who furnished it' to the>iV^> 
President’s Comnission. He asked the AG to do everything /■ 

possible to have tlie parties responsible for the infamous . ^ -v 
publication to be apprehended and exposed. According to'^iV1 : 
Zeysegg *e description of the "clipping” it appears it is a 
copy of a leaflet discovered by cur Agents in Dallas on - 
11-21-63, in the 300 block of South Poydras Street. Since 
1946 Zeysegg has written the Bureau and other Government , , 
agencies. No further action necessary as Zeysegg’s •; 

"clipping" Is in possession of the President’s Commission. 

Zeysegg is the subject of Bufile 100-105019. : \ 

Several "see” references similar to his written communications 
in his main file appear in other files. Information regarding 
the leaflets obtained from 94-37374 serial 172 retained in v

Dear Mr# Kennedy I • *■ 

’ . • '-* v > “V= /;*■' \ “ t 

One ef my hobbles la world-wide stamp collecting t 
to this effect I am In contact with foreign collectors of n. 
countries who I exchange stamps with* ,-v : ; ; : * 

Some months ago# one of my exchange partners In - 
Czechoslovakia sent mo a stamp-letter In which also wa3 enc 
a clipping of a Czechoslovakian newspaper* 

In his letter# he explained that this article appeared in o 
of the Czechoslovakian papers some time AFTER the assassins 
of President Kennedy* * 

This shocking clipping showed the picture of Presi 
Kennedy - front and profile - 
and below was printed in capital letter l 

•This man is worreed for treason* • 

Next to the picture were enumerated the points why he Is wa 
In short# it was like a rogues gallery picture* 

Since It was printed In Czech - with the exception of 'This 
is wanted for treason'which v/as printed in English - 

my correspondent tried to translate for me some of the poin 
enumerated next to the picture* . .. . 

“Even he, a native and resident of a communist country voicec 
his deep concern and regret over this shocking exposure of c 
late beloved President and apologized for sending me this 
clipping* ■ 

This article the clipping shows Is supposed to be 
reproduction of the original leaflet printed and distributee 
by some secret organization in US «• 

long before President Kennody announced his \itention to vi: 
Dallas# Texas* 

How this leaflet supposedly originated in US came into the 1 
of that nowspnpor in Czechoslovakia - before or after the nr, 
of President Kennody remains unlcown* 

It can be assumed that a roporter or diplomat of one of -the 
communist countries stationed in US - somehow got hold of o: 
of the .originals and later - after the assassination of Pro: 
Kennedy - made it available to that particular newspaper wte 
then copied and produced it* . 

I ' 



1 


It is hardly conceivable that any responsible paper < 
even a communist country would dare printing such an offen 
and shocking matter which might entail farflung Internatio: 
repercussion without having substantial proof at hand - 
meaning the original* . - ......... i 

\lo were so grieved and shocked over it that at first 
I didn't know what to do with it* ? 

Finally I decided to write to the Daily News about It and i 
for advice* . • - •. - > • ••• 1 — • 

I received the following reply s :■;/'$ 

" Dear Sir* ; . ' ' 1 

The subject op which you have written has come to oui 
attention before in several forms* * 

It is ohly proper that you make your Information aval 
to Senator Kenneth Keating since such an inquiry coul! 
involve the higher echelons of government# where we c 
have access* 

Thanking you for your Interest# sincerely## v r 

William T^KcCar thy 
_J J V Daily News Edit 

.. . ■ - : " : '/r. ' " 

*• followod this advice and mailed a letter with the enclose 
clipping to Sonator Kenneth Keating. 

4 roceived a reply from him# dated April 24# 1964 wit 
following contents* 

Dear Mr. Zeysegg* ' 

Thunk you for your recent letter and the enciosed cli 
from a Czechoslovakian publication with reference to 
late President Kennedy* 

I appreciate your sending It to me. It is a sh-i A ‘:cing 
story which I have called to the attention of 
Commission now investigating the assassinatio.. 2 
President Kennedy* . 

Very sincerely yours* 

* V / ■; / . J/ 

j . , “ Kenneth BUj Keating, 





A~ 


Aa for this shocking clipping, many questions, of co 
arise now In one 1 s mind - such as l — 

Did our Embassy in Prague know about this article and repr; 
uction of the original presumed to have been printed and 
distributed in US ? ; 

Has our State Department been informed about it *• and if s< 
why have the so facts been withheld from the American peopl< 

7/ho or what secret organization was behind it f ^wT-' 

Could the murdor of the assassin been a prearranged matter 
in order to silence him T 


As of now, we see nothing mentioned about this in the 
preliminary roport of the Commission* 

7/e wisch, Mr. Kennedy, you would try to see this horc 
clipping for yourself v/hich presently rests with the Commie 

V7e can find no words that could adequately express or 
deep concern and indignation about this matter and we wish 
see the memory of our beloved President Kennedy vindicated. 

7/e beseech you and trust you will do everything in yt 
power to have the parties responsible for this infamous 
publication and betrayal of our late President whose memory 
wo cherish apprehended and exposed* 

Ploase accept our profound apology for bringing this 
disturbing matter to your kind attention* 


I have the honor to remain 
most respectfully yours.

By appointment, I introduced William Manchester, who has be 
commissioned by Mrs. John F. Kennedy to write a book concerning the four days v 
surrounding the assassination and funeral oLthe late President, to the Director at I 

10:10 a.m., today in the Directors Office. — G X. - P . 

Mr. Manchester first thanked Hie Director Tor ^seemglumeC^He explained [\ 
that he had already seen approximately 90 people, principally in Washington; however, ^ 
had not yet gone to Dallas, Texas, inasmuch as Chief Justice Warren felt that he should v 
not conduct interviews in Dallas until after the Warren Commission report had been issued 

• • • O s* 

In instituting a series of questions to the Director, Mr. Manchester first> 
inquired as to what the Director was doing on November 22, 23, 24 and 25, 1963. r--^' 3v 
Manchester added that he would first like to start with November 22, 1963, at the precis^, 
moment the Director first received the news that the President had been shot. The £ 
Director replied that he had just returned from lunch. This was approximately 1:10 p. m£ 
A news item was brought in to him reflecting the President had been shot. The Director * 
Immediately called the Attorney General who was at his home dining with the U. S. I 
Attorney from New York, Mr* Morgenthau* The Director advised the Attorney General £ 
that a news announcement had been made that the President had been wounded. The 
Director stated he next talked to the SAC of our Office in Dallas, Texas. He was informec 
that the President had been wounded and had been taken to the Parkland Memorial Hospital 
The SAC also advised that Governor Connally had been shot and was now in the emergency 
room with Kennedy at the same hospital. Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally, tfrho were 
riding in the same car, had not been hit. The SAC told the Director that it appeared that 
the shots had come from an upper £ory window of the Texas Book Depository Building.

“ ‘ “ Tlie Dallas Office additionally advised the Director shortly after 2:00 p, nr. 

that day tiiat the President liad died. The Director immediately called the Attorney . , 
General once again and told liim of the death of his brother. At tliis time the Director 
inquired as to whether the Attorney General planned to go to Dallas. The Director state 
that he Jiad advised the Attorney General that if such plans were in the making he would 
facilitate his departure and arrival. The Director told Manchester that shortly thereaftc 
cur D?.llas Clfice called once again to indicate that the Presidents body would be 
immediately flown back to Washington and that the Vice President had already been swor 
in as ^President. The Director later called the Attorney General once again and told him 
tiiat the FBI was moving into the investigation. The Director advised Manchester that th 
FEI took this action despite the fact that there was no law making it a Federal violation b 
assassinate the President. • - - • 

At this point the Director gave Manchester a brief history of the 
assassination of SAC Shanahan in Chicago, Illinois, in the middle 1920 ? s. There was no 
Federal law against assaulting or murdering an FBI Agent at that time. The Director 
told Manchester he initiated action to make it a Federal crime to assault or kill an FBI 
Agent so tiiat proper action could be taken in Federal court rather than a local court in 
such matters. 


! 


The Director told Manchester that if the FBI had taken custody of . 

Lee Harvey Oswald, Jr*, Oswald would never have been killed by Jack Ruby. The v 
Director stated that the murder of Oswald by Ruby naturally gave rise to considerable 
speculation and rumor. All of this could have been avoided had the Dallas police taken 
proper actioh to protect Oswald. • , * 

The Director told Manchester that the FBI immediately entered the case, . 
despite r.on-jurisdiciicn, and tiiat we interviewed Oswald as soon as he was made available 
The Director stated tint on the evening of November 22, 1963, at approximately 7:25 p.m. ; 
President J ohnson called him at his home and requested that the FBI take complete charge 
of the case involving the assassination. The Director stated he advised the President 
tint the FBI liad already entered the case and that we. would, of course, go all out in this 
matter. The Director also told the President tint he was concerned about the great 
amount cf publicity coming out of Dallas. •

, The Director then told Manchester that the Dallas police had given out^ 
considerable information received as a result of FBI findings, particularly from cur 7 
Laboratory. He added that on the 4th or 5th day following the assassination he instructed 
our SAC in Dallas to contact Chief cf Police Curry and order him to make no further — 
statements to the press with respect to the evidence or investigation surrounding the 
assassination. r i. . director told Manchester that tliis Chief of Police could have told

him to go to hell; however, ho had recognized the obvious necessity and logic of such * 
instructions and had complied. The Director explained to Manchester at some length < 
the necessity to keep physical evidence confined prior to the prosecution of an individual 

The Director told Manchester that on Saturday evening, November 23, » 
1963, our Dallas Office had received an anonymous telephone call indicating that plans 
lnd been made-lo murder Oswald when he was removed from the Dallas City Jail. The 
FBI informed the Dallas Chief of Police immediately. The Director told Manchester ; 
that original plans for removal of Oswald had been made for 10:00 p.m. that Saturday 
night. The Chief of Police, however, changed these plans by acceding to the pressure 
of the press that Oswald be removed at a convenient time so that communications media 
could cover the event. Cur Dallas Cilice again called the Dallas Police Department on 
Sunday morning, November 24, 1963, and reminded that Department of the same 
anonymous telephone call. At tliat time the Chief of Police assured our Dallas Office tk 
all precautions were being taken to protect Oswald. • ^ '

The Director informed Manchester tliat following the President’s call 
at 7:25 p.m., November 22, 1963, he gave specific instructions that the FBI do everyth 
possible to thoroughly investigate this case. The Director stated that additional 
personnel were immediately sent to Dallas. He told Manchester this was necessary 
inasmuch as cur Dallas Office and FBI Headquarters, as well as other offices, received 
hundreds and hundreds of phone calls, telegrams and letters setting forth leads in this 
case,'-- • . ' . •• . 

Manchester inquired as to .whether the Director placed any significance 
to the anonymous phone call concerning the plan to murder Oswald. The Director replic 
that we had no way of knowing at the time whether any importance should be attached or 
not; however, we did have the responsibility to Immediately notify the Dallas police, 
which we did. ;=.• ; 

• The Director characterized Jack Ruby as somewhat of a "police buff. " 

As a result of his friendship with a number of police officers he had easy accessibility 
to the Dallas Police Department. The Director stated that he did not know whether Rub} 
reporle.d insanity was of the sincere or faked type inasmuch as we were not psychiatrist. 
He stated that Ruby h-.d given the excuse that he had lolled Oswald because of his obviou. 
affection for the late President and the fact tliat he wanted to prevent any further sorrow 
to Mrs. Kennedy inasmuch as she would necessarily have to return to Dallas and testify 
against Oswald, *' r , ' • ■'

Manchester inquired as to the Directors immediate reaction. The Director replied that 
his first thought was how such an event could take place, particularly under a system of 
civilized justice. The Director added that he liad ordered an immediate check on Jack 
Ruby and particularly to ascertain if there Iia.d been a relationship between Ruby and 
Oswald. ’ ** ; i’cc : 


Mancliester inquired as to whether the Director was watching television 
at the time of Oswald's murder. The Director replied in the negative. He stated he was 
working on official papers at the time. The Director added that he usually saved Sunday:

morning. .

The Director told Manchester that his first conversation on November 22, 
1963, with err Dallas Office occurred at approximately 1:48 p.m. The Director was 
advised at that time that the President was not believed to be dead yet but that he had 
suffered a mortal wound. The Director mentioned that on the occasion of his second 
call to the Attorney General, the Attorney General had indicated that he had also been in 
touch with a number cf die Presidential Staff ancl had been informed cf a number of 
details concerning the shootir.g and the fact that the President had died. 


Manchester inquired as to the Director's opinion ox the Attorney General's 
reaction’upon being informed tliat the President had been shot. The Director replied 
that the Attorney General had been silent for a few moments and had then requested that 
the Director keep him informed cf any further facts received concerning this matter.

' Manchester told the Director that the President’s call to the Director at 

fc25p.nu, Novem; r 22, 1963, appeared to be one of the first calls that the President 
made upon returning to Washington that evening,. The Director replied that he would' i 
surmise that this was correct. The Director added that our investigation proceeded 
forthwith; however, it was not until Monday or Tuesday of the following week that the 
President decided to name a Presidential Commission to look into the assassination. 

The Director told Manchester that an FBI report had been sent to the Warren Commissic 
vitliip ten days after the President had set up this body. The Director stated that he 
personally hud appeared before the V/arre.n Commission and that he considered their ' 
Questioning of him to be quite thorough. He stated lliat thoroughness was necessary on 
the part of the Commission inasmuch as tliis would serve to assist in quelling gossip and 
speculation in the future. The Director quickly added, however, that rumors will 
continue concerning this case, especially in Europe v/here there is widespread gossip 
concerning a supposed conspiracy, for many years. , ^ ’ 

* • * * . / . 7* ' -\7; *’ 7. 7^-7^777 ■ ' ■ 

The Director told Manchester that the statement that some of the 
information may be withheld by the Warren Commission naturally gave rise to further 
rumor. Manchester replied that he cculd understand the Chief Justice’s statement in thi 
regard inasmuch as not just any individual should be allowed to look at the classified 
material sent to the Commission by some agencies. The Director replied that the issue 
in point is such that excessive precautions cf security is unwise. The Director explainet 
that he had never been a great believer in wasteful precautions or going overboard 
regarding excessive security. He stated that an item is either classified or else it isn’t 
classified. . The Director gave examples of leaks In Government that have given several 
Presidents extreme cause and worry. He stated that the FBI is usually called upon to - 
investigate these leaks, however, newspapermen naturally do not desire to reveal their 
sources. The Director stated that if newspapermen did reveal such sources that quite,,: 
naturally the sources would dry up, 

Manchester inquired of the Director as to whether the assassination case 
became one cf major concern following the President’s call at 7:25 p.m., November 22, 
1963. The Director stated that as he had previously indicated, the FBI had already 
entered tills case. He added, however, that after the President’s call we went all out in 
doing such things as working around the clock, sending a Washington-based FBI official

Re: William Manchester, Author of Kennedy Book 
To Be Published in 1CG9 

' ' Appointment with Director, 10:10 ryn., 6-4-64 

Manchester ashed if the matter cf a President being assassinated not 
being a Federal crime had ever been discussed fully by the Congress, or anyone else , 
according tc the Director’s knowledge,, The Director replied that there had been no 
discussion to any extent. He stated the matter had just never been considered, c 


- - 


Manchester inquired as to whether the FBI had prior material on Oswald 
before the assassination. The Director replied that we did have some information 
regarding Oswald, however, it was quite flimsy in nature. The Director then explained 
at sofne length the background of Oswald, He told Manchester of the press releases that 
Oswald made in Moscow. He told Manchester of Oswald’s employment in a factory Iii : 
Minsk, Russia, and of the fact tliat Oswald had later returned to Moscow. The Director 
stated that lie certainly did not Understand why the Department of State had failed to have 
Oswald sign an affidavit forfeiting his American citizenship at the time Osv/ald returned 
to Moscow and visited the U, S. Embassy. Manchester spoke up and stated that the 
State Department claimed they had wanted to find out if Oswald had committed an : 
extraditable crime in the Soviet Union, therefore, no signed affidavit was taken from 
him. The Director again deplored the failure to have such an affidavit executed. 

The Director continued that v/e had interviewed Oswald within two or thre 
days following his arrival in the United Slates. He explained that we, of course, desirec 
to find out if Oswald had been recruited as an intelligence agent by the Soviet Union. Th 
Director told Manchester that this did not appear to be true. He added that Oswald had 
classified himself as a Marxist rather tlian a communist. The Director added that ..... • 
Oswald had later been interviewed in New Orleans after getting into a street squabble 
with anti-Castroitcs over leaflets being handed out by Oswald. The Director told 
Manchester that Oswald could best be termed a "loner." He explained Oswald’s 
communications with the Communist Party in the United States but added that Oswald 
had never joined the Party* The Director told of the incidents surrounding Oswald’s . 
attempt to loll General Walker in Dallas. He added that Oswald’s wife, Marina, had * 
advised us cf this incident following the assassination. The Director summarized this 
part of the interview by indicating there appeared to be nothing in Oswald’s background . 
winch would reflect that he was a man of violence and most certainly nothing which 
indicated that Oswald had any intentions of assassinating the President. . v 


i . '• Manchester asked if the Director did net find it odd that Mrs. Csw'ald 

• had -alied to tell anyone about the attempted assassination of General Walker until after 
] the iv rler of President Kennedy. The Director replied that he did not find tills odd in 
i view-- vi -he cold relationship between Oswald and his wife, the language barrier on the • 
\ part of Mrs. Oswald and the fact that Mrs. Oswald did not have the natural instincts of 

| Am erican woman but to the contrary had a different attitude altogether. He stated he 
f placed no significance in Mrs. Oswald’s failure to advise of this incident prior to the

. — e Director told Manchester that it was extremely difficult to speculate; 

on the motivations cl Oswald to kill the President, The Director stated it was entirely | 
possible Oswald may liave wanted to loll Governor Jchn Connally, He explained that . ] 

Oswald had written communications to Governor Connally protesting his particular type* 
of discharge from the U. S. Marine Corps, The Director added that President Kennedy 
was an intcllectu:i liberal typo. He stated that President Kennedy had been desirous of 
keeping peace with honor. He stated that President Kennedy desired peaceful co-exister. 
— American -lyle. The Director added that the President, although he had been firm ’ 
in Ms dealings with Khrushchev, liad a fairly good relationship with Khrushchev and the 
Soviet Union, The Director summed up by stating that Oswald could not have desired to 
kill the President because the President had dealt liarshly, or spoken harshly, against 
the Communist Party and Chairman Xlirushchev, • ■ '' ♦ 

Manchester speculated that perhaps the communists, including Oswald, ; 
did net like the relationship between the late President and Khrushchev; therefore, the 
communists desired to do av/ay with President Kennedy so that this obstacle to their 
desired philosophy c Id be removed. The Director replied that this was entirely 
possible/ however, he wanted Manchester to clearly understand that Khrushchev was not 
a person to be trusted and tha . Chairman Khrushchev had a very cold and evil mind. 

The Director, at this point, gave examples of Khrushchev’s understanding of the English 
language despite the fact that lie had wroyanovslry, an excellent interpreter, with him 
at all times while on'his visits to the United States, The Director told Manchester tha* . 
he had always felt it better to lack individuals like Khrushchev on the shins once in a 
while rather than to boot-lick them. The Director explained that Khrushchev was 
basically ah oriental and that individuals opposing orientals usually lost face in the 
oriental’s opinion when fear or trepidation was shown, t A A \ At 

Mjr.chcster inquired as to whether the Director’s duties and * ' v 
responsibilities allowed him to pari icipate personally in the funeral ceremonies. The *' 
Director replied in the negative* He stated he I_ad been at his desk constantly. He 
added that he liad issued instructions tliat FBI personnel participate officially in the 
ceremonies by assisting Secret Service as much as possible. The Director spoke of the 
many visiting foreign dignitaries and of the .dangers Involved in the march from the 
White House to £t. Matthew’s Cathedral* He told Manchester that over 40 Special 
Ag nts had been assignee! to assist Secret Service, particularly at St, Matthew’s 
Cathedral, He further told Manchester that the authority to protect the President was ; 
clearly a function of the Secret Service; however, since the assassination we have 
assisted when called upon. The Director briefly advised Manchester at this point of the 
immediate widespread ramifications of this case following the actual shooting. He told 
Mv.uhc-sLjr that leads had spread to Mexico as well as throughout the entire United State 
There fere, it has been necessary ior him personally to .remain at his desk so as to 
supervise this mattery 1 — t-t-- — r : r# y t 1 v T'rrrrr^-r - ' -

Numerous communications have been received bearing 1 

the assassination caption (instant case) Which contain inf or- 
m3ticn concerning OSWALD and/or his connection with the assassi- 
nation, and ouch communications are being filed and reported in J 
the case bearing the OSWALD caption. For the moat part, miscel- v 
laneous allegations bearing on the assassination are reported in 
instant case and all others in the LEE HARVEY OSWALD case. All 
information pertaining to items of evidence in connection with ' 
the assassination related to OSWALD are being reported under the 
LEE HARVEY OSWALD caption. 

The overlap in the period of this report with that of 
previous reports in this matter was occasioned by the fact that 
material with respect to certain allegations v^.s withheld until 
such time as the complete resolving of the particular allegation !y 
could be included In one report. Also, much c£ the information/ ’ /*; 
contained in this report originated with ether cffices. j 

The contents of this report merely reflect those 
allegations which, in the opinion of the Dallas Office, have 
been resolved completely. Numerous other allegations are under' 
investigation or the Dallas Office is awaiting receipt of . . 

appropriate FD-302*s and inserts and, upon receipt of same, ' 

another report will be submitted in instant caption.

they have been sufficiently resolved, recognising this report;

some of the complaints included are so nebulous it is difficult 
to determine what, if any, investigation can be conducted to 
resolve such allegations. In each Instance every effort has . 
been made to conduct Whatever investigation was believed logical© rr 
It in felt that any additional investigation into the potential 
for harming the President with respect to any of the indi- ^ 
'viduals mentioned should lie within the Jurisdiction of the U. 8. 
Secret Service; however, it is. felt that no matter how nebulous 
the information available may be the Bureau should include such 
information herein. j;-:. v.-;

was necessary to conceal the identity of the source of the infor- 
mation in the details, such source is identified as reflected ,

Where investigation has previously been reported in 
connection with a particular allegation mentioned in this re-

is reflected is set forth. In such Instances where the title of

In some instances, information contained in this report 
w?s compiled by other offices from information previously sub- 
mitted via letterhead memorandum and, therefore, the date of

five days. 

No local dissemination of this report is being made 
pending receipt of instructions from the Bureau to the effect 
that such report may be disseminated to the U. S. Secret Service

stated that it v;33 information she had obtained while : • 

"looking out the window at dusk". 


Hiss ADAM3 stated that her apartment was • ; ' 

"tapped" by local, state and federal authorities be- •

The President's Commission, by letter dated June 1,” 

1964, furnished the FBI at Washington, D. C., a telegram ; \ . 

dated May 22, 1964, forwarded to the President's Commission v 

by the Department of Justice, vfoich telegram was from _FRANK_ 
_C.*^kSaBRS , 47 40 R ichard, Fort Worth, .Texas , which stated, "I 
wish to testify before Warren commission."^ fipp fr't 

The files of the Dallas Office of the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation reflect that on November 13, 1963 , FRAN K.. •' - ; t' •; 
Rakers , 4740 Richard, Fort Worth, Texas, appeared at the Fojt • 1 . 

Worth Resident Agency of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
and was interviewed by SA B. TOM CARTER. On that occasion, 

AKERS stated that he was employed as a civilian at the Army 
Reserve Headquarters in Fort Worth from November 1961, to 
January 1963, at which time he was discharged for inefficiency. 

He stated that in about December 1962, a fellow employee at the 
Army Reserve Center gave him a cup of coffee and, that after , 
drinking some of this coffee, he became very weak. He stated 
he poured the rest of the coffee into a container and he r ' 

exhibited same to SA CARTER at the time of this interview. 

AKERS requested that the FBI analyze the contents of 
the coffee. AKERS was advised that the FBI had nothing to do 
with employer-employee relationships a(h{! that, this was a matter 
that should be discussed with the Civil Service Commission and 
not the FBI. 

AKERS continued that he had held numerous Jobs and 
had been fired from most of them. He stated that on most 
occasions he had made complaints about fellow employees or the 
quality of the work being performed by employees, and that the 
, supervisors apparently did not appreciate his efforts.

On December 30, 1963, Mr. ROBERT J. CARTER, 
Georgia State Board of Corrections, Atlanta, Georgia, 
provided SA JOSEPH F, AYERS with a letter he received 
from O. L. "JACK" ALTMAN, General Delivery, Corpus 
Christi, Texas. The text of the letter is as follows: 


:. V\”V ". T 
*'•• *- «•>* ’ j 


. "To Warden Hoke Smith, at this Yuletifle Season: 

"The Bible tells us, if we have Faith the size of a 
mustard seed, mountains will be removed, even Stone 
Mountains. 


“V 




"To you with the hardened heart (if you have any at 
all) toward humanity, and especially with the victims 
.under your Iron Fist, may I say, that it is my ernest * 
Prayer, that my God who is more powerful, than even 
you, will deal with you JUSTLY, and bring down on you 
the same misery you force on some men in your Prison 
Walls. While you as a free man, are enjoying the 
Christmas Spirits, or your bottled spirits, may He 
cause you to stop for a second and think about the • - 
souls you have deliberately denied even a mere few 
kind words at this the Yuletide Season. Leaving those E 
that might be a little more Reverend than you might ' 
be, with only the Joy of knowing They have a Heavenly 
Father who is besiefe them. To keep the records straight, 
let us assume that you, as JLn simular occasions, seldom ? 
have the time to think of Christ who died on that 
horrible tree, and to think that He died there, and - 

shed his blood for all men, the good and the bad. Yes, 
he shed his life blood for even you and your kind, that 
continue to deal out misery on such a broad scale. 

"If your inmates should .revolt against the treatments 
they have forced upon them, as is so wide spread across 
your state, I do hope you will be one that will be as 
mistreated as the ones you manage. If there should ever 
bt such a thing as a prison riot break loose behind ■ 
your walled city, I do hope you get the blunt of it. 


"My daily Prayers are in Jack Bass's behalf, and not 
yours. For the punishment idea that you passed upon, 
to make him another of the FORGOTTEN MEN by stopping 






"him from any outside contact with the world. You 
-.Ho£e Smith, passed that sentence on Jack Bass. And 
my Daily Prayers are always as a request that God, 
who has more power than you, will not forget that man, 
and will make some way for him to KNOW the truth about 
WHO w’as the one that really let him down - his captor. 
Even though I have tried to the limit to put across 
an appeal to the, so called, Christian Pastors around 
Georgia, for the raall moral favor to help get that 
man word as to what has been dished out from you to 
him. But alas, in this present day, it takes more 
than a hundred such pleas to the Modern day preachers, 
to find even one, who is willing Vo lift his hand in 
ai:y w’ay to correct such a horrible condemnation as 
you have brought upon one under your boot heel. 

"Kven though I am aware that you possibly hide behind * 
the probable fact, cf perhaps having your name written 
some Church Book, and also behind the excuses and 
alibis that you are surely familiar with, none cf that 
really gives ycu a pardor. for your cruel actions. May 
Cod have mercy on your scul. As a gentle reminder, 
m?.y I cite to you, that my solmn Prayer was answered, 
when I asked my Father tc s^ep in and prevent John 
Kennedy from stooping to step onto the platform of the 
leftist N.C.C, due Dec." 3i*d. And I have not felt ba d 
about the method He did choose. To HIM goes my praise. 

''/s/ 0. J-, •JACK* ALTMAN 

"/t/ 0. L. 'Jack' Altman 


"P.S. :: '• --' 'V 

"Every time I show those ?431folds, that Bass entrusted 
with me,<2Usay a silent pr'ayer that Cod show him the 
light, regardless of the precautions you take to prevent 
him from knowing the truth.* 1 . — ,

The files of the FBI, Houston, Texas, contain the 

* following information regarding ALTMAN t .. 

On February 28, 1961, an individual using the ■ • ; . . 
name of 0. L.XALTMAN, 30a Rio.. Grande,. Victoria,- Texas r 
telephonically contacted the headquarters of the FBI in 
Washington, D.C., and stated he was President of the local 
anti -communist group. He stated the Police Department had 
caught two men at the city reservoir who were obviously : v 
communists trying to poison the city. He pointed out that ; 
the Police Department had not followed through properly. . 
and that the FBI should handle this "sabotage case." 

On March 15, 1961, Chief of Police ELMA ANDERSON 
was contacted to determine whether or not he had any know- 
ledge of an attempt to poison the waterworks at Victoria, 
Texas. He stated during World War II, two individuals were 
found climbing up on the waterworks and a rumor got out 
they were attempting to poison the water; however, he stated 
there was no basis for this rumor. 

On March 15, 1961, Mr. F. C. URBAN, Vice President, 
Victoria Bank and Trust Company, Victoria, stated he knew 
ALTMAN and ALTMAN considered himself to be a communist 
hunter, and he, URBAN, considered AI/rMAN "a little off" along 
that line. . .. ; v \..r 

On July 25, 1962, Mr. A. G. SCHWARTZ, County " ’ 

Attorney, Lavaca County, advised the Hallettsville Sheriff* s 
Office that ALTMAN was spreading seditious and slanderous 
literature concerning the President, Vice President, and

On August 16, 1962, SCHWARTZ advised that ALTMAN 
had been living in Hallettsville for approximately a year 
and wa3 engaged in the furniture repair business. He said

advised that investigation 

was conducted in the City of St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada, on 
May 25, 1964, in regard to the anonymous letter postmarked St. 
Thomas, Ontario, April 27, 1964, and addressed to the Dallas 
Office of the FBI. 

« 

In the opinion of the source, the letter originated 
with a patient in the Ontario Hospital, a mental institution 
located in St. Thomas. Dr. K. MC GREGOR, Assistant Superin- 
tendent, was interviewed but could not identify the handwriting 
in the letter, and stated that the envelope and paper used are 
not identical to that supplied to patients by the hospital. He 
also stated that numerous patients from this institution are 
allowed considerable freedom, including the privilege of visiting 
downtown St. Thomas during daylight hours. There would, there- 
fore, be nothing to prevent a patient from purchasing writing 
paper and envelopes in St. Thomas and mailing letters from the 
Post Office. Dr. MC GREGOR knows of no one else who was or had 
been upset in respect to the assassination of President KENNEDY. 
Dr. MC GREGOR further stated the hospital records contained no 
reference to JACK WEBBER or JACKET RASHER. ’ /-/ > Q — 




was interviewed and advised that in the past he has received 
letters containing similar wordings and phraseology, and has 
received letters concerning the KENNEDY assassination in vfoich 
he vaguely recalls some mention being made of the "Four Jacks 
in a deck of cards." Chief WHITEMAN stated he considered at 
the time of receiving these letters that they originated with 
a mental patient in the Ontario Hospital and he destroyed them 
arid took no action.

ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE CALL TO NBC, ' : 

LOS ANGELES, RECEIVED BY MRS. HELEN . 1 

MILLER: " ^ C: • y-^i :^||||| 

At 3:45 PM, November 22, 1963 , Mrs. HELEMMILLER, ^ 
a telephone operator on the switchboard at the JI&tLisnalw 
Broadcasting Company_XNBC.) ,_L0S .Angeles , California,- tele- 
phoned the Los Angeles Office of the FBI and furnished the 
following information: A 

Two days before the bombing of a church in Alabama, 
which happened several weeks ago, she received a call from 
a man who said he had a news item for the network. He said 
he was a Negro, had a Masters Degree and taught literature. 
Mrs. MILLER said the caller to her sounded well educated 
and, while distraught, was definitely not drunk. ^ ‘ 

This caller told her that on the previous evening 
he had attended a meeting of seven well educated and well 
known Negro men of the Los Angeles area. These men decided 
"to kill him." The caller kept repeating to Mrs. MILLER 
"They're going to kill him." She tried repeatedly to have 
the caller identify who was going to be killed but he would 
only answer "When this happens, you will know about it. 

The caller said he left the meeting and since then had been 
in a terrible state trying to make up his mind what to do 
as he did not believe "killing him" was the answer and he 
wanted no part in the plan. 


Mrs. MILLER repeatedly attempted to get some 
identifying information from the caller. The only thing 
he mentioned was a claim to have written a poem entitled 
"Open House" which had been printed in the "New York Times. 
He said he received $30.00 for the poem but did not say when 
it had been printed. He read it to her and she was able to 
take down the opening lines:

"MAN SAYS VISION WARNED HIM OF KENNEDY DEATH IN 
ADVANCE 


"B. A. Birdwell, a Mt. Enterprise farmer, 
said Tuesday that he had a vision concerning 
President Kennedy's assassination two weeks 
before it happened and tried to warn Dallas 
authorities of the danger. 

"Nobody would take his warning seriously, 
according to Birdwell, \4io is a parttime 
preacher. *■■ 

"Birdwell said he received his first 'vision 
from God' about two weeks before the assassi- 
nation. The vision showed that Kennedy would be 
shot in the back of the head, he said. Birdwell 
claims he told county Attorney Bill Ferguson and 
Assistant County Attorney Robert Allen about the 
vision before Kennedy's death. Ferguson says he 
•does not remember Birdwell telling him about the 
vision. Allen also says he does not remember any 
such discussion. 

"On the day Kennedy was shot in Dallas, 
Birdwell says he had a second vision about an 
hour before the actual shooting. It gave more 
details of the tragedy, he says. Birdwell said , 
he could see the brick building at the corner of 
Commerce and Elm in Dallas and also saw the 
assassin in his vision.

"According to Blrdwell he haotlly called 
the Dallas county Sheriffs Department and told 
them about his vis lop. He said the man he 
talked with, who he thinks was the sheriff, 
did jjot take his warning seriously. 

"’Our President could have been saved • ' 

if he had only believed me, 1 Blrdwell said. 

"Blrdwell says the vision about President 
Kennedy was not the first forewarning he has 
had about a tragic event. In 1947 he claims he 
received a vision about the Texas City disaster 
several days before it happened. Blrdwell says 4 - 
he was working in Texas City at the time. In 
his vision he saw a large number of buildings 
destroyed. Blrdwell says he told his boss about 
the vision and quit his Job to return to Mt. 
Enterprise. He tried to preach on the streets 
to warn the people in Texas City, he says, but 
they would not believe him. A few days after he 
left Texas City the city was rocked by the 
explosion vfoich killed more than 409 people, he 
claims. . .. ' . 


"Blrdwell says he wrote a letter to Mrs. 

Kennedy about his vision and received a letter 
from her. He plans to write to her again to 
give her more details of the vision." 

Mr. BEATHARD said he had interviewed BIRDWELL, and 
had printed the story, even though in his own mind he feels that 
BIRDWELL is a mental case.

ben a<> BIRDWELL, Mount Enterprise, Texas, is known in f- 
the county as being mentally unbalanced. BIRDWELL claims tO^A^'v 
receive "visions from the Lord" telling him of coming events. - 
It is always after these events have already happened that V 
BIRDWELL will tell people of having had a vision predicting ‘ 
this event. BIRDWELL has no occupation other than he J 

occasionally butchers cattle for people and he preaches 

•some on street corners in Henderson and Mount Enterprise. 


On about May 15, 1964, BIRDWELL came in to FERGUSON'S 
office and FERGUSON'S assistant, ROBERT ALLEN, and Tax 
Assessor - Collector TOMMY HASKINS, JR. were also in FERGLSCN's 
office.. BIRDWELL told them that he had a "vision from the 
Lord" the previous day that some seamen were going to kill 
President LYNDON B. JOHNSON. BIRDWELL wanted FERGUSON to call 
President JOHNSON and to warn him of vfoat BIRDWELL had seen in 
this vision. When FERGUSON refused to make the call, BIRDWELL 
then accused FERGUSON of being responsible for the assassi- 
nation of President JOHN F. KENNEDY. BIRDWELL said he had 
been in FERGUSON'S office about two weeks before President 
KENNEDY was assassinated, and had told FERGUSON and ROBERT 
ALLEN that he had had a "vision" that President KENNEDY would 
be assassinated in Dallas, and that FERGUSON had refused to 
do anything about it. BIRDWELL said he had then called the 
Sheriff '8 Office in Dallas, Texas, at 11:00 A.M. on No- 
vember 22, 1963, and had told them of the impending assassi- 
nation, and had even described to them the building and the v 
window from Which the fatal shots would be fired that day. 

Mr. FERGUSON continued that both he and ROBERT ALLEN 
told BIRDWELL that they could recall no such conversation per- 
taining to the impending assassination of President KENNEDY, 
and that this conversation had never occurred. -

BIRDWELL then contacted TOMMY HASKINS, JR., Who also 
told BIRDWELL he had not been present during the alleged conver- 
satlon, and would not consent to be photographed with BIRDWELL. 

Mr. FERGUSON continued that BIRDWELL said he was going 
to pray that FERGUSON, ALLEN and HASKINS would remember the 
conversation. BIRDWELL stayed around the court house most of 
that day, and later in the day BIRDWELL asked him again if he 
remembered this conversation, and FERGUSON again said that he 
did not. BIRDWELL then said that the devil was in FERGUSON and it 
was for this reason that FERGUSON could not remember the conver- 
sation. 


On the evening of May 19, 1964, the “Henderson Daily 
News" carried a story concerning the alleged vision by BIRDWELL,

by his third wife, ages 2 to 13, and he has a seventh grade : 

education. He is unable to write, but has learned to print o 77 ; y 77»- : -- 
He has a small tract of land and a three-room house in which 
he and his family live. He does not farm his land as it ie 
in the Soil Bank Program. He picks up odd Jobs, but has no 
steady work or source of income. His electricity and tele- & 

phone have both been disconnected due to overdue bills. 

^ . H * 

Mr . (JJIRDWELL continued that since 1947 he has beun 
receiving "visions from the Lord" and also "radio waves from 
the Lord" telling him of impending disasters and deaths. 

Although no church will accept him as a minister, he spends 
a lot of his time preaching along the highways, and on the " 

streets. When he gets emotional in his delivery, he then 
speaks in an unknown- tongue. 


About two weeks prior to November 22, 1963, he had 
a "vision from the Lord" in the middle of the night, warning 
him that President JOHN F. KENNEDY would be assassinated in - - 
Dallas, Texas. The next day he went to the Post Office In 
Mount Enterprise, Texas, and purchased a stamped envelope 
from Mr. BRINKLEY, the Postmaster. He had Mr. BRINKLEY 
address the envelope to President JOHN F. KENNEDY in Washing- 
ton, D. C ., as he, BIRDWELL, does not write well. He also 4 
wanted BRINKLEY to write a letter warning President KENNEDY 
that he was to be assassinated, but BRINKLEY refused. BIRDWELL 
then printed a letter to President KENNEDY, warning him, and - 
mailed it at the Post Office. He never received a reply to • 
this letter.

KENNEDY for him, but FERGUSON refused. Now FERGUSON, ALLEN and 
HASKINS all deny he told them of the impending assassination. 

* At approximately lls30 A.M., November 22, 1963, he 

was praying at home, and had another "vision from the Lord* > 
showing him the location of the building in Dallas, and the 
window from which the fatal bullets would be fired at Preeidfent v 
KENNEDY that afternoon. He tried to use his own telephone, but 
"the devil was in his phone", as it would not work. He then 
drove into Mount Enterprise and used the pay telephone at the 
bus station, having the operator charge it to his home number, 
3536, Mount Enterprise. He called the Dallas Sheriff's Office 
and talked to some man, and told him of his vision, and that 
President KENNEDY would be assassinated that afternoon. This 
man thanked him, but said he did not think the Lord would put 
out any such visions. 


He continued that he wrote to Mrs. JOHN F. KENNEDY , 
and, in this letter of consolation, he enclosed a newspaper 
clipping which told of his son being shot in the head by his 
uncle in Mount Enterprise about two days after the assassination 
of President KENNEDY. Also in this article was mention of 
donations being sent to BIRDWELL, although he did not ask Mrs. 
KENNEDY for a donation. He received a letter from Mrs. KENNEDY'S 
secretary, which he displayed, which thanked him for his letter 
of consolation, and it also said that Mrs. KENNEDY would be 
unable to help him as she was utilizing all her resources to 

build the Kennedy Memorial Library.

advised, that on the weekend followlrg the assassination of : 

President KENNEDY she arrived home and her daughter told her^ '■•'■fV * 

that ELVIS CHANCE, a casual acquaintance of hers, had telephoned 
and she returned his telephone call. She advised that CHANCE - - 1 

seemed rather indefinite when she called him and to make con- v H- 
versatlon she mentioned the assassination of the President and 
how horrible It was. At that time he Indicated that he thought r 
It was "O.K." or "pretty nice,” or words to that effect.. She • 
advised that she was shocked at the time and after thinking it ; 
over she decided to report the matter just in case he might be 
serious about his feelings in this respect. She advised that 
he had possibly said this in a "smart alec" manner and was not 
serious about it. 

She stated that she had known CHANCE about three years 
and had met him through his wife who had formerly worked with 
her (Mrs. OWEN) at Community Hospital in Durango, Colorado. 

She stated that CHANCE and his wife hav« been separated for 
some time and people have tried to say that she (Mrs. OWEN) 
had broken up the marriage, but there was no truth in this and 
she has not had a very close relationship with him. She advised 
that she did double date one time quite a while ago with CHANCE 
and his wife, but this Is the only time she knows of when they 
had any social contacts. 

Mrs. OWEN advised she seems to recall that on one 
occasion CHANCE had made some critical remarks regarding 
Catholics, but other than these two isolated remarks she knows 
nothing further specific regarding his views and ideas. She 
stated that CHANCE has apparently lived In the Durango area for 
five or more years and has been employed by the El Paso Natural

could not recall making any statement concerning the Idea that he ?

stated that if anyone received such an Impression from anything y 
he said concerning this matter, It was completely misunderstood - 
and misconstrued on the part of anyone receiving such an Idea. 

He stated he could not see how anyone who had any knowledge of 
him at all could receive the idea that he could think in such a 
• manner. He stated that if It had been within his power to stop 
such a thing from happening, he certainly would have prevented It, 

CHANCE advised he recalls seme conversation at the El ■••• - 
Paso Plant In a joking manner by unknown parties, with him possibly 
making .such a statement himself to the effect that "the only way 
the Texans could get a man in the White House was to have an . 
assassination" or words to that effect. He advised that this 
was not said In a malicious manner and In no way Indicated any 
approval of the assassination. 

CHANCE reiterated that he did not recall ever saying 
anything which could be construed as approving the assassination 
of the President and if anyone had received such an impression. 

It was erroneous.

statement to a customer (name unknown) that the country was 
not out much in losing President KENNEDY. The exact words 
were not recalled by Mrs. WOOTTON, and she did not hear any 
other statements regarding President KENNEDY. CLOUSER did 
not seem to have any hatred for the President but seemed to 
like to take opposite points of view in any subject of dis- 
cussion. CLOUSER appeared to be a braggart, who was anxious 
to get attention. He did not appear to be a dangerous sort 
of person but was mild-mannered and courteous. 

Mrs. LUCILLE CARTER, waitress, Corliessen’s Cafe, 
Pleasant Grove, adviced on December. 6, 1963, that on December 
4, 1963, at about 2:00 p.m. , a man, whose name was reported

She stated he was reading a newspaper and commented upon a 
picture of President KENNEDY, saying, "It's good he’s gone. 
They mourn too much for him and not the other guys.” At 
•this point Mrs, CARTER walked away and did not hear any 
. further comments regarding President KENNEDY. She stated Dr- 
* DOYLE/jJARRETT was present during a portion of the above-men- 
» tioned conversation and may have heard a part of it. •

"Governor 0. WALLACE went to Texas two days before > 
assassination of President KENNEDY. Gave JACK RUBY $35,000 
which was supposed to be divided between RUBY, OSWALD, and a -7.

I was there. In other words I was working in the Governor's, 
office. I would like for you to get in touch with me at 353

The receptionist upon giving him (SHORES) the message 
which had been left by JERRY COLEMAN, also informed him that

"Dear Sir: 


U 


" On Dec. 20th 1963 I left Baton Rouge La. 

From Oct. 1st 1983 to“Dec. 20th 1963 I .^7 

worked as BarTender at the Capitol House Hotel In 
Baton Rouge La. prior to that Job I worked at 
the Trade WTnds Hotel In Biloxi, Miss, for about 18 
months, and I also worked at the Gulf^Hllls Dude 
Ranch in Ocean Springs, _Mlss for about 22 months 
and about 6 weeks at the Officers club in Ft. 
Benning Ga . I spent about 4' years down South. I 
was bartender at all these pTaces. 

•" I returned here to my home in Ohio Dec. 24th 
1963, after over .a 4 year absence . 

" The reason I left. Baton Rouge, some of 
the people In that area did not like me because 
I am a "Yankee." 

I had a couple of interesting things I seen • 
happen at the Capitol House that may interest you.. 


• " Three or four days after the President was 

. assassinated, a young m3n of about the age of - p 
; • .* 25 to 30 years^ came into the bar and had a 

# few drinks, then asked me how everything had 

heen going the past few days it was the first time 
-- I ever seen him, then he told 1 me everything 

was going just fine^ I didn't realize but he was ■

he was sending dollar bills up to the piano player 

by bu3 boy, and requesting the song Street of 

Dreams, then he told me that was a Texas song. I said "what 

do you mean Texas Song?" He said "down in Texas we kiTl 

them." I think he was referring to the assassination, then 

he started talking about Castro, but I was busy and 

didn't hear every thlng^ he was trying to pick on me^ this 

time he told me his name was Yansen, he took a taxi 

home both times.

he knows something, it has been worrying me, so I*

his name as ARGOSKI or AGROSKI (phonetic) or some other similar 
name. He mentioned that he was of Polish extraction, and that - 
his father had been a coal miner somewhere in Pennsylvania.

also came from a coal mining area. COLTON had never seen the V : ■ 
man before this visit. The man stated he was employed by an 
overseas insurance company, selling insurance overseas. The 
man stayed at the bar for about a half hour and had two beers.

According to COLTON, many people in the Baton Rouge £»/£' '• J 
area had been making derogatory remarks about the late j 

President, and on one occasion after the assassination and 
before the ’funeral, some of the people sitting at the bar had ’ " 
told COLTON to turn the television off, that they were tired • *' 

of hearing about the assassination. COLTON does not recall 
the identities of any of the individuals who made derogatory... ' 
statements, or who requested that -the television set be turned 
, off. Asked why he took more note of the man mentioned above, 

COLTON stated that this man seemed "odd." He was unable to - - 

give any specific reasons why this man Impressed him differently ’ 
than did the other people who frequented the bar. 

About threq weeks after the first visit to the bar, 
the man returned. He sat down at the bar at about 8:00 PM, and 
stayed there for about an hour and a half or longer. During ; 1 
the time he was at the bar, he had three or four beers. When . 
he entered the bar, he acted as though he had already had a few 
drinks. He was feeling "good," that is, he was not drunk, but 
was somewhat "tipsy." About four or five times he gave the 
busboy, a Negro male, named P£ARL AUTREY (phonetic), a dollar 
bill and asked him to have the piano player, GENE ELSNOR (phonetic), 
play a song called "Street of Dreams," or some similar name, 
exact name not recalled. The man told COLTON that the song v ‘ 

was a "good old Texas song.." When COLTON asked how the song 
could.be a Texas song, the man said, "We kill them in Texas on 
the street of dreams," or some other words to that effect. 

On this occasion, COLTON reminded the man that he had seen him 
I in the bar before, and asked. his name again. The man said his 
! name wa^fYANSEN o^YANNEN, or some other similar sounding name, 

"j He is not certain of the sound or spelling of the name the man 

I * ave ih/JX2±/- £■-#-_ L r z r -> >2B- 

’ The man, on this second visit to the bar, acted as 

t.hough he was trying to pick a fight with COLTON, ‘ COLTON does 
* hot recall the various things the man said that caused him to 
believe the man was trying to fight with him, but does recall 
that he showed the busboy a ring he was wearing, a large ring 
with a square setting, with ’a red stone in the setting, and 
made a remark ( to the effect that , he could smear COLTON's face'

COLTON overheard the man talking to PEARL AUTREY^^S 
the busboy, and heard him mention something about CASTRO, but 4%^ 
does not know what the man said to AUTREY about CASTRO. PEARL 4s 
AUTPvEY should recall the man, because COLTON mentioned to .0'4 :; ;v 
AUTREY that he would never forget the man. The Cashier and 444^4 
waitresses at the Hunt Room of the Capitol House should recall 
the man, and may be able to recall more of his conversation than 
COLTON, 'because it was a busy evening, and COLTON was serving , 
.other customers. COLTON does not recall the name of the . • 
Cashier and recalls only that one waitress had the first name 
VERA, last name unknown. 



PEARL AUTREY, who engaged in conversation with the 
man, attends college in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. COLTON does 
not recall the name of the college. 

COLTON was again asked why he felt the man mentioned 
above would know something about the assassination of President 
KENNEDY. Again he was unable to furnish any specific reasons 
for this belief. He could only say that the man acted 
"differently" from the other people in the area, and "didn*t , 
seem right." -- •’ •. . 4 ' v * 

During the course of the interview, in describing V 
the man in relation to himself, COLTON described himself as 
5*8" tall, 180 pounds.. His full name is GEORGE COLTON, and 
he has no middle name. He is single and was raised in the * 
Fairpoint, Ohio, area.

lie is currently employed a bus boy in the 
Room of the Capitol House Hotel, Baton Rouge/ 

He is acquainted with one GEORGE COLTON, former tsrteadef' •' 
in the Hunt Room and recalls the individual whom COLTON 
referring to named YANSEN or ARGOSKI, although he did not.// 
recall ever hearing the man identifying himself by 6iihsr . /;••. 
of these names. PEAPL recalled seeing this man in the bar 
the first time a few days after the assassination of President 
KENNEDY and saw him in the bar probably three or four more: ; * . 
times within the next month to six weeks. PEARL did not 
believe that the man has been in the bar since approximately 
Christmas of 1963. PEARL stated that on each occasion tfc^t ' > 
the man came into the bar, he appeared to have been drinking ’ 
quite heavily and therefore took anything that the mar might '• 
have said with a grain of salt. 

PEARL recalled that the man apparently liked the 
song, "Street of Dreams" as he requested the piano played, 
employed in the Hunt Room at that time, first ran* GERE, to 
play this song each time that he came into the bar. Ke ga^e 
GENE a $1.00 bill to play this song each time. PEARL got 5, - ; 
the impression that the man was from Texas as he So^mel td 
recall the man mentioned Texas several times although he,/. 
cannot recall any exact statement that be may have mats 
concerning Texas. 

The matter of the assassination of President KENNEDY 
was still much in discussion on the first occasion that the 
man came into the bar and PEARL recalled that after the man 
was quite well under the influence of several beers he made 
a statement that he was a brother of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, jf.ot 
paying much attention to this statement, PEARL cent / 
about his duties and a few seconds later, overkesjrd the rian 
say something. to the effect that "he could have done the • 

Job himself". He assumed that the man was referring to the 
assassination. / 

PEARL stated the man was a very heavy beer drinker, 
and that beer, in fact, was the only alcoholic beverage *

She recalled that very shortly after the assassl-.^i 
nation of Fresident JOHN F. KENNEDY, a mar. came into the :v* 
bar on two or three occasions, each time in an intoxicated ’ • ^ 
condition. He continually "ran down Baton Rouge," and every- 
thing in general and it was her opinion that he was the 
type that hated everything and everyone while he was ' Y 
drinking-; He always had a belligerent attitude. He talked 
# distastef ully concerning Fresident KENNEDY. He made the 
remark that "what happened to him was good enough for him, and 
that if he had had the chance,' he would have done the same - 
thing." v ' . . • 


She did not recall hearing him say where he was 
from, but believed someone in the Hunt Room stated he •. 
claimed to be from Texas. She did recall that he gave 
AUTREY PEARL, busboy in the Hoot Room, several dollars to 
have the piano player play "Street of Dree.ms," which , apparently 
was his favorite song. ’ 

She paid very little attention to anything he said 
and considered him just a "blcwhard." It was her impression , ; 
that he was off a ship and that he was trying to make a 
big impression. She stated that he usually had a smart-aleck - 
grin on his face. She said that he was always alone* . .

She is employed as* a waitress in the Hunt Room ’ 7 :*$?;.^: 
of the Jack Tarr Capitol Hause Hotel, Batcn Rouge, Louisi- 
ana . She recalled that sometime shortly after the assassina- 
tion of President JOHN F. KENNEDY, a man came into the Hunt 
Room two or three times, usually In the evening, each time • 
partially intoxicated, and cn each cccasicn requesting "Street 
.of Dreams” be played by the piano player. - 


She knew when she saw him ccme into the Hunt Room 
that he would request that song. He was always alone when he 
came in and usually, by the time he left, he was "pretty 
well saturated." 


She recalled that he "jabbered a lot” and tried 
to make a big impression on Miss COOPER, the cashier, whom 
he appeared to like, but she dees not recall any specific 
remarks that he made concernlrg the assassination of 
President KENNEDY or of president KENNEDY. 


It was very likely that he did make seme remark, 
as almost everyone that came into the Hunt Room had something 
to say about the assassinaticr., usually in disrespect. 

She said she paid no more attention to anything 
this man said than she did to what anyone else said who 
came into the bar. 

She did not recall him mentioning his name or ' 
stating where he was from. She has not seen him in several

DUANE 0. DEWEESE, also '3 JS:5? 

Known as Pete Dewees e ; .. i’XSfi -:HI a ; !};>;■ 

:a>- ■-•■■’■■ ■ - On December 24, 1963 , Mr. ROBERT wAfevERS,f^^| 
2063 Lockwood Lane, Santa Maria,. Calif ornia* advised •. 
that~he raises cattle and hauls waste material from John 
Inglis Frozen Foods Company, Santa Maria, to feed his 
cattle. He stated about two and a half months ago, he 
met PETE DEUEESE, who is employed as production manager 
for Stouffer Foods Company, 38 OO Woodland Avenue, Cleve- 
land, Ohio, and has been at Santa Maria on a temporary 
basis developing a process for adding cheese to broccoli 
and cauliflower before it is frozen, inasmuch as the v: ; 
Inglis Company is packing and freezing produce for the 
Stouffer Company. Further,- that DEWEESE worked in the iy 

quality control laboratory while at the Inglis Company v 
but that he completed his work and left for Cleveland 
by airplane on December 21, 1963 , and that it is not 
known at the present time whether DEWEESE will return 
to Santa Maria . 

RIVERS stated that on November 23 » 19^3 » the 
day after President JOHN F. KENNEDY was assassinated, one 
of the women at the John Inglis plant mentioned the assass- 
ination, and PETE DEWEESE, in the presence of RIVERS, made 
a statement to the effect that it was good that President 
KENNEDY had been killed, and that maybe BOBBY KENNEDY 
would be next. Further, DEUEESE did not appear to be •: - . 
Joking. He informed that he was shocked by DEWEESE* s _ 

statement and did not discuss the matter with him further. 

He stated that he suspects that DEWEESE is an atheist v 
because DEWEESE has commented several times that it is 
unconstitutional -for children to be allowed to read or 
say prayers in public schools, RIVERS said he has no . 
information concerning the background of DEWEESE and 
that he had never heard DEWEESE discuss politics,

quite possible that he could have been mistaken to the effecfc|l^4«t 
that he was glad KENNEDY was killed. DE WEESE stated in facfc#^^> ; 
this was not his personal conviction. He stated that politically" 
and philosophically he was and is opposed to the late president . 
and the President's policies. He advised that he never had, nor..^ " 
ever could, conceive of himself condoning any type of violence ^ , 
and that -he has a high respect for the office of president of the 
.United States. He stated that in this regard he had respect for ; 
President KENNEDY inasmuch as he held this office, although he ^ 
did not hold the same respect for KENNEDY as an individual. He . . 
stated that he personally was quite upset by the assassination of 
President KENNEDY, mainly for the aff rontry to the office itself 
that any individual would have the audacity to perpetrate such a v”v’ 
crime. He advised that he does not ever recall making a statement 
that BOBBY KENNEDY might be next. He stated that perhaps be may 
have said that BOBBY KENNEDY might be the next meaning that he ; 
might possibly be the next President of the United States. • 

DE WEESE stated at the time of the assassination so 
many opinions had been expressed by individuals and the various 
news media as to why the assassination took place it was his 
immediate belief that it most likely had been done because of 
the President's civil rights policy or the Federal government's 
coming more into State government affairs. He stated that he : 
thought perhaps some member of the extreme right might have -V 
committed the crime and he was in fact surprised when it turned 
out that OSWALD, a liberal, committed the act. >/.' 

DE WEESE stated that he first learned of the assassination 
of President KENNEDY from DON J-^SCHWIEN, P 1 an t_ Manage r,_ John,., 
Inglis Frozen Foods. Santa Maria, California, and upon first \ 
learning” it, he stated that it was unbelievable. He stated that 
he supposed that perhaps he had been outspoken in his views 
concerning the KENNEDYs but that he sincerely regrets the death of 
the President Just as he would have regretted the death had any 
other President had been assassinated, but as for the man KENNEDY 
himself, he was opposed to the direction that he was leading this 
country, but he once again wished to reiterate that he certainly 
could never condone assassination or violence by any group or any 
individual as aneans of securing his own political beliefs. n ,

DE WEESE stated that he was quite concerned over having 
been questioned concerning such a thing and he stated that he would 
certainly be more guarded in the future about expressing his ^ 
thoughts less they be misconstrued by others and given a meaning 
entirely different than that which was intended. .,

She reportedly said that the night before

she obtained employment with the Toddle House Chain 
as a waitress in Waco, Texas. She worked at their 
number 2 house, which is located on Highway Number 6. 

She remained in Texas until the beginning of December, 
1963, at which time she returned to Ft. Lauderdale, 
Florida. While working at her job in Texas, she had one 
regular customer who came in about five times while 
she was there. He usually ordered coffee and referred 
to it as "KENNEDY Coffee". She asked him what he meant r 
by that remark and he said "black coffee in a white cup." 
This was about the extent of her conversation with this 
individual because when he came in she was usually quite 
busy. •' • 

She worked either the 5:00 PM to 2:00 AM shift 
or the 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM shift. ■ 


She recalled that the night before the 
assassination of the President, this Individual came into 
the restaurant in the same manner. She mentioned the : 
President's pending visit to Texas, and he said, 

"If he went into Dallas, he'd never come out alive." 

He explained that the feeling of the Texas people was 
not in favor of KENNEDY. 

When she heard the report of the President's 
being killed, on the following day, she immediately 
thought of this man. She never had the feeling that he 
had anything to do with the assassination, but she felt . 
he was strongly opposed to KENNEDY. >; 

; - At the time this individual made the comment /.^/^ 

concerning the President going into Dallas, another 
employee, BOBBY/BRGWN, a short order cook, was also T” 
present. When she went to the office on that Friday,, to „

remembered the man's visit to the restaurant, and what v 
he-had said. BROWN commented, "I'll bet he's an awful .•; ! 
sick man this morning." ■> 

This man did not come back into the restaurant 
until two or three weeks later. He seemed very self 
conscious and made no reference to "KENNEDY Coffee."

SIDNEY 0. GLOVER 
and FELIX COX 


V/ ALTER w. GUSTIN, Warrant Officer, U. 8. Marine , . 
. Corps (USMC), advised on November 24, 1963, that at approxi- 
* mately 10:40 PM, November 23* 1963* he received a telephone 
call from an individual who used the name FELIX COX (pho- 
netic), GUSTIN tool: this telephone call in Headquarters, - 
USMC Staff Duty Office, Arlington, Virginia* The call was 
originally placed to General DAVID M, SHO'JP, Commandant, 

USMC, who had loft his office prior to receipt of the tele- 
phone call. GUSTIN advised that COX instructed him to write 
down a message to be shown to General SHOUP. The message," 
according to GU3TIN, was "Tomorrow all the free world leaders 
will be together in one place." At this point, COX made 
some mention of former President EISENHOWER, but GUSTIN wa3 
unable to recall exactly what v/ac said concerning EISENHOWER, 
GUSTIN advised that COX then said "Look out or watch for a 
followup on the Dallas ir.cide .v-." GUSTIN advised that COX 
did not specifically stave anyone would be shot or that any 1 
attempt would be made to harm any of the free world leaders, : 
but this was a definite inference which GUSTIN received 
through talking with COX. GUSTIN further advised COX indi- 
cated he was calling from Corpus Christi, Texas, and com- 
mented he only had $1.00 to spend on this call and could 
only talk for three minutes, GUSTIN also stated COX claimed 
to be a former Sergeant in the Marine Corps. : 

Major H. R. MARSHALL, Duty Officer, USMC Head- 
quarters, advised the Washington Field Office of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation on November 24, 1963* that no record 
concerning one FELIX COX was located in the files of the 

USMC. . . ; ... 

. On November 24, 1963, LOUIS BENAVIDES, Special ' 

Agent in Charge, U. S. Secret Service, San . Antonio, Texas, ■ . 
•advised the San Antonio Division of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation that he had been informed by his headquarters. -c- 
in Washington, D.C., that on November 23, 1963, a man iden-‘ ^

Federal Bureau of Investigation and furnished the following f.g : 
information; . . •. 

HALTON stated that for 30 years he has conducted 
research concerning extrasensory perception (ESP). He said 
, that in the November 28, 1963, issue of the "Los Angeles 
Sentinel*p_a Negro newspaper, he observed an article wherein. - 
HELEN C ^GREENWOOD is quoted as having reported having a ^4^ 
"vision" of the assassination of President JOHN P. KENNEDY > f 
approximately two months prior to November 22, 1983* HALTON 
stated that because of his interest in the field of ESP, 
he immediately contacted GREENWOOD and in_his opinion her 
"visions" have been accurate . / £jtl Qi t- c i r/ '\

HALTON stated that^rough hrs~i«tervreVs with tmm 
GREENWOOD she told him that she had received another "vision" 
in which she predicted that four members of the KENNEDY ^ 

family would die before the KENNEDY "clan" was out of power. 
HALTON advised she told him .that JOHN P. KENNEDY was the 
-first; .JOSEPH P;&KENNEpY. would-be the second (to die of 
natural causes}; ROSErKENNEDY would be third (to die of • 
natural causes); and xhe fourth had not yet been identified 
to her. HALTON stated she could not predict when these 
events would occur, and she had indicated she expected ;V 
subsequent visions to fill in the exact dates and the , / 
identity of the fourth member of the family. : ’VV r

HALTON advised that GREENWOOD also told him ■ 
that a vision had told her that it is dangerous for 
JACQUELINE* KENNEDY, widow of the late President, to con- 
tinue to visit the grave of her husband so often. She 
said that a vision informed her that after the eighth 
visit to the grave, one of her two children would be 
kidnapped, .

" HALTOH said that GREENWOOD claims to regularly 

correspond with persons in high places by letter, telephone,- , y r\ 
ana telegram. He said that by telegram dated November 24,;/ — 
1963 , she sent her condolences over the death of President 
KENNEDY to U.S. At torn ey Gene ral RO BER T— F ^ K ENNED Y and Mrs . 

JOHN P. KENNEDY. He said that in the past she has reportedly 
been in contact with President KENNEDY, Attorney General ^ 
ROBERT F. KENNEDY, California Senators ENGLE and KUCHEL, : . ™T 
California Governor.. ED^ro_GT^ROV/N, California Congressman ~ 
JAMES ^ROOSEVELT, and many others." He sal^ she^has^dvlsed - ” -i 
the persons she contacts of information coming to her : . . 

through “visions." 1 

HALTON advised that GREENWOOD said she advised 
the FBI in Los Angeles as well as many state and federal -V.v" / 
officials of her vision of the death of President KENNEDY 
prior to his death, and HALTON asked if this was true. It * 

was explained to HALTON that the FBI files are confidential 
and this information could not be furnished to h im. It is ‘ 

to "be noted that GREENWOOD did not furnish information ^-Vx. 
concerning this vision regarding the Presidents death to . 
the FBI in Los Angeles. 

The newspaper article in the "Sentinel” referred 
to by HALTON quoted* Mrs. GREENWOOD as follows: "I also 
went to the local FBI, told the head man there about my - . 
vision and asked them to have the President and his brother 
Robert covered at all times. I said they couldn*t go South. 

The FBI man only smiled at me and referred me to a young /.'VI'.-: 
*punk. * I guess they thought I was crazy." 


HALTON said GREENWOOD told him that she had 
the highest regard for the FBI and that the quote in the 
newspaper article attributed to her was inaccurate because 
she never told anyone that the FBI head had referred her 
to a young "punk." - - v. :

It is to be noted that a review of Los Angeles Office

GREENWOOD in which she said she had a vision of the death o£ 
President KENNEDY. - -wT ? - 

— A review of Los Angeles FBI files shows HEI£N C. - : ';- 

GREENWOOD is identical to HEIEN CROZIER GREENWOOD, who was' a ' 
victim in a Civil Rights matter in Los Angeles case entitled, 
"UNKNOWN SUBJECT/ HELEN CROZIER GREENWOOD - VICTIM. * 

GREENWOOD has contacted the Los Angeles Office on nu- ; 
merous occasions complaining that her civil rights have been , 
violated. In- the matter referred to above, she complained that 
she had attempted to give testimony to the Los Angeles County 
Grand Jury since 1959 concerning a threat to kill her by her 
t _ husband, MYROVgrEENWOOD. She complained that the Grand Jury ; 
had refused to allow her to testify in violation of her civil 
rights. She further complained against the treatment of her by 
the Los Angeles County Bureau of Public Assistance, Los Angeles 
County District Attorney*s Office, Loa Angeles Police Department, 
and many others. ■. . .* 

'* , She claims to have corresponded by telephone, letter 

and telegram with high placed individuals in Government, including 
President KENNEDY, Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY, U. S. Senators 
/■/ENGLE and-KUCHEL, California Governor PAT BROWN, California Con- 
gressman JAMES ROOSEVELT, and many others. GREENWOOD claims to 
be a membejr of the "Negro Press Bureau" and as such "carries a 
lot of weight." '.’-.’'O', •

In addition to the above information, GREENWOOD tele- 
phonically contacted the Los Angeles Office on April 30, 1963, 
to again complain about "crooked" state and county officials. 

' She could furnish no facts to substantiate this allegation. 


. . On May 10, 1963, she again telephoned the Los Angeles 

Office with the same complaint. Later in the day on May 10, 1963, 
she personally appeared at the Los Angeles Office, at which time

gration views. Mrs. JOINER advised that BOBBIE is not generally 
liked by the rest of the JOINER family, as well as in the neighbor- 
hood in which he lives and operates a grocery store, and she con- 
siders him to be of low mentality. She advised BOBBIE has taken

restricted his sons* visits to their uncle, BOBBIE JOINER, 

Inasmuch as BOBBIE has caused his sons some police trouble 
because of his radical views and he, therefore, felt it wise 
not to allow his sons to accompany BOBBIE JOINER on any of his 
frequent picketing trips.

coming a chapter of the White Citizens Council, whose main office

ADiAI^sfEVBNSON in Dallas* He said in furtherance of this protest 
he rented an "Uncle Sam" red and white striped suit and donned 
long white beard and attempted to enter the auditorium to effect :< 
the protest. He advised, however, neither he nor any other member 
of his group was allowed to enter the building any further than the 7 
lobby; therefore, they conducted their protest in that area of the 
building. He advised he recalled there were several other groups 
carrying signs, which he believed to be from a group led by General 
EDWIN A. WALKER and a group from the John Birch Society. He advised, 
however, there was no violence conducted by any of his group and the 
individual responsible for the spatting assault on STEVENSON was not 
known to him and was not a member of his group. 

■" 

JOINER stated the next protest picketing which he and his 
group organized was to be conducted at the Trade Kart on the arrival 
of President KENNEDY, who was scheduled to speak at that location 
during a luncheon engagement on November 22, 1963. He stated that 
he, ROY and RAYMOND JOINER, and two other members of his group made 
several placard signs to carry depicting the following statements* 

"KENNEDY, KING AND CASTRO" 


"HAIL CAESAR" 


'YANKEE GO HOME" 


All of the above signs carried the designation on the ; 
back "Indignant White Citizens Council." He advised he and his i 
group arrived at the Trade Kart Building at about lls30 AM, November 
22, 1963; and to6k up a position on the north side of the Stemmons 
Expressway service road in front of the Trade Hart. Ha advised > 
they each carried a sign and each had a large piece of adhesive tape 
stuck- over their mouths to abide by a recent City Ordinance, No. 1003, 
which had been passed a day or so following the STEVENSON rally. 

This ordinance made it a misdemeanor to make any statements verbally

his group crossed to the south side of the Stemmons service road, 
but were toj-d by a police officer in that area to return to their :;?<■- 
original position on the north side, which they did. He stated 
they remained in that position until about 12* 35 PM, when the " 

KENNEDY motorcade sped by their position at a high rata of speed. 

He stated they were not aware what had taken place at that time 
and It was not until a few moments later when a bystander announced 
that President KENNEDY had been shot, or shot at, that they .learned 
anything was wrong. He advised that moments later police officers 
took him and his group into custody and subsequently charged them 
at the police station with "Investigation of Conspiracy to Murder 
the President. * He stated this charge was later changed to "Tres- 
passing* and, after remaining in ths County Jail in Dallas from 
that time until Monday afternoon, they were released upco paying

»RY action against the President of a violent nature. JOINER em- 
phatically denied discussing cr planning to discuss the matter of 
the assassination of President KENNEDY with ROY JOINER, his nephew, 
or anyone else. JOINER explained that, although he definitely dis- 
agreed with the integration policies, as voiced by President KENNEDY 
and others, he held the highest regard and esteem for the office and 
felt that only his picksiting might result in bringing to the attention 
of individuals in public office who advocated integratiera his feelings 
about the matter. ;

KENNEDY on November 22, 1963, he had received many hundreds 
letters from individuals who were sympathetic to his cause and : 

to his thinking, many of whom sent contributions to aid in hi*

advlsed, however, that none of these letters, to the best of his 
recollection, contained anything relating to KENNEDY, or to vio** v V>v1>' 
lence of any form against KENNEDY or anyone else* JOINER recalled,' 
hgvsver, that he did receive one letter about one week following the 
assassination from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in New 
York City or Washington, D. C*, to the effect that they had read of y 
the arrest of himself and his group on November 22, 1963, and the 
subsequent detainment for a three-day period and offered the services 
of an ACLU attorney if they desired to be represented in court* 

JOINER explained he has since filed a lawsuit against the Police . 
Department and the individual officers involved for false arrest* > 

He stated, however, he did not answer the letter because he had - 
heard of possible communist infiltration of the ACLU, and did not. 
desire to be represented by an organization of that type. JOINER 
advised that all other letters received by him have been congratula- 
tory letters on their cause against integration*

Consul’,, stated he is an artist by profession, and also gives 
arij lessons to various people in the Phoenix, Arizona, area^f^^^ 


In 1957, Mr. COZE hired JOHN ALBERT KENNEDY to ; 
model before one of his art classes. JOHN ALBERT KENNEDY 
had been referred to Mr. COZE by Dr . HARRlVwOQD , Profess qg 
of Art at Arizona,State University, Tempe, Arizona .« “ 


tested 


i At about the same time, Mr. COZE had been requested % 
by OLEG^CASSINI , of New.York, New York, to assist in the planning, 
and decoration of the Knickerbocker Ball, to be held in New York,' 
New York in 1957. The theme of this ball was to be "American V ^ 
Indians." Mr. COZE was instrumental in raising $15,000 among . rl v' 
people in Phoenix to assist in presenting the problems of the 
American Indians, especially those in Arizona, at the ball. 

n 

/ In June, 1957, Mr. COZE requested Senat or_BARRY. — - 

-fTGOLDWATER to be a speaker at the ball on the American Indian, P P 
and the problems of education. Inasmuch as Senator GOLDWATER 
had other commitments, he suggested to Mr. COZE that he ask 
then Senator JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, Whom GOLDWATER referred ; 
to as "the next President of the United States." 


Apparently various members of his art class heard 
of this and knew he had secured the promise of the late 
President to speak at the ball. It was apparently because 
of this association with the late President that Mr. COZE 
received the following letter from JOHN ALBERT KENNEDY, which

JOHN ALBERT KENNEDY, 5163 South Van Ness 
Avenue, Los Angeles 62, California, furnished the 
following information: *. ■:/ : i-f 

■' '■•••'• * ? " V ** ' ’ •’ . * ' /’ -* ' # /.> / ^ Vi’’* .. .* '''' ^ 

v KENNEDY is an Indian. He stated that in 1930 
he knev/ a man by the name ofySRONSMAN who had a distillery 
at Villelasalle, Quebec, Canada . He could not recall the 
name of this distillery and was unable to furnish the 
first name of BRONSMAN. ■ 

In December, 1963* he saw an advertisement in’ ^ 
a newspaper, the name of which he could not remember, . • 

which had in it the name of LEE HARVEY OSWALD. In view 
of the fact that BRONSMAN had been a bootlegger during 
the Prohibition Era, he wrote the name of BRONSMAN on the 
side of the article which bore OSWALD’S name. He then tore ; \- 
it out of the paper and put it in an envelope and addressed 
it to EARL WARREN, Chief Justice of the United States, care 
of the United States Department of Justice, Washington, 

D.C. .... ....... .. 

KENNEDY said that he thought that this bit of 
information would resolve the assassination case of OSWALD. 

He was unable to explain why. There were long periods 
during the conversation in which KENNEDY would sit and • • 

stare at the floor. Certain portions of his conversation - -..v 
were incoherent and did not deal with the question at hand. 

KENNEDY took this envelope to the La Tijera ~ r 
Post Office Substation. He put the name of GEORGE PERRIN 
and the address 2021 West Vernon, Los Angeles, as the - 
return address. He admitted that GEORGE PERRIN was a 
fictitious name and that he had never known anyone by the 
name of PERRIN. He also admitted that 2021 West Vernon % ,> - v 

was a non-existent address.

for this envelope which he addressed to WARREN, He 
claimed that when he mailed the letter that the Postal 
Clerk stood on a chair and looked out the window and 
took down his license number as he drove away, Subse- 
quently, a woman called at his house making a survey • 
and asked him if he had any children under 18 years of 
age. He said his was the only house on the street which 
was visited and he believed this was some kind of a 
pretext. He could not explain the reason for these r tv- 
actions, 

KENNEDY advised that he realized if he put 
a fictitious return address on the envelope that it 
would not be returned to him. He said the reason he 
put return receipt requested on the envelope was so 
that it would get "special handling." 

KENNEDY advised he has no information con- 
cerning the assassination of President JOHN P. KENNEDY • 
and that both LEE HARVEY OSWALD and JACK RUBY are com- 
pletely unknown to Him,

the Philadelphia, Pa., and the Washington, Offices of the 

Federal Bureau of Investigation on a number of occasions, and has 
furnished various complaints and allegations of violations of 
the law. In most of these instances, he was generally vague and 
sometimes incoherent. • "" . - - 

On September 7, 1954, HARRY KNABLE, who stated he*

he wished to furnish information concerning various crimes in 
Philadelphia, Pa. He was unable to furnish any specific

RE: WACHA HcCOLLUM 


The following Investigation was conducted by '/6^ 
SA EDWIN DALRYMPLE : . . 

On November 26, 1963 , Detective D. D. COLLINS, 
Houston, Texas, Police Department, advised he and other 
officers of that department had been present in the motor- 
cade accompanying President KENNEDY from the airport to 
downtown Houston on November 21, 1963 , and he had observed : 
a light aircraft towing a sign, flying parallel with this f 
motorcade. Detective COLLINS reported he observed this 
sign to consist of the phrase "Coexistence is Surrender," 1' 
Detective COLLINS stated he had neither observed nor heard 
reports of any other aircraft having appeared over Houston 
during this period towing any type of sign bearing a - 
political slogan. 

On November 26, I 9 S 3 , Hr. JOHN BLAIR, Control 
Tower Chief, Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), Houston Liter- 
national Airport, after consulting individual air traffic 
controllers who were on duty in Houston on November 21, 

1963, reported the only aircraft engaged in activities as - 
set out above on that date was a Cessna aircraft bearing ; 
identification number 26 b, BLAIR stated he had determined 
this aircraft was based at the Genoa Airport, 


--.V- On November 26, 1963 , HUGH RAULERSON, Inspector, 

General Aviation District Office, FAA, Houston, Texas, 
advised his office grants waivers which are required of , 
all aircraft flying over the City of Houston for the pur- , 
pose of towing signs, and the only aircraft presently 
/authorized for such activities was owned by JAME&J?*-. 
^yC^RAUQHj 602^r_iqn,Lane,JPasadena,„Texas, 

* • •*■ RAULERSON further stated that he had received no 

'information indicating AT-6 type aircraft had been operating 
in the Houston area during the above period and he had re- v; 
ceived no requests for waivers from a Hr, HcCOLLUM from 
Danville, Illinois, or from any other person during the 
above period. • 









Genoa Airport, Genoa, Texas, advised he was familiar with 

‘the" flight 'of the Cessna aircraft number 26 b on November 21, : r 

1963, and had assisted Mr. JAMES P, BRAUCH in removing the : 


sign which had been pulled by that aircraft. 


On November 26, 1963, Mrs. JAMES F # \feAUCH, 

* Arion, Pasadena, Texas, stated her husband had contracted 
"to pull a sign bearing the words "Coexistence is Surrender" 
over the City of Houston on the afternoon of November 21, 

1963. Mrs. BRAUCH stated the persons arranging this flight 
had made all the arrangements by telephone, had refused to 
furnish their identities and had paid for this service by 
cash without identifying themselves. Mrs. BRAUCH stated 
no written receipt or invoice was prepared in connection ^ v 
with this transaction and she could not identify the persons 
who contracted for this service. ' • 


Shortly after the above interview, Mr. JAMES P. 

BRAUCH telephoned SA EDV/I1I DALRYMPLE at the Houston Office 
3 of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and stated he desired 

to furnish additional information concerning this matter. 

J Mr. BRAUCH stated tint the above services were rendered for 
I a man who gave his name as JOEYBRYANT and gave his telephone 
/ number as MI 5-5319. BRAUCH stated that BRYANT paid him . ' ! 

} $225 . 00 in cash for this service and he prepared and fur-. . ; ,Y • 

1 nished to BRYANT a signed receipt prepared in longhand. - 
■ Mr. BRAUCH stated he had received no other inquiries from 
I any other source in connection with a possible flight over 
, / Houston during the period of the visit of President KENNEDY. < - 

* The following investigation was conducted by 

>: SA’s EDWIN DALRYMPLE and JAMES W. RUSSELL: 



On November 27, I9S3 , JOE rYbrYANT, Sales Engi- 
peer. Rapids Standard Company, .Inc,, -2216. Walker Street,™ 
residing at 5963 Belneath, advised he v/as the individual 
who arranged for the sign .to be towed over the City of 
'Houston on the afternoon pf November 21, 1963. BRYANT 
6tated that he was a member of the Jolin Birch Society but 
that the above operation /was not connected with the John 
Birch Society or any other group but resulted simply from , :C; 
the informal activities of himself and a group of friends

l r ho collected money for this purpose. Mr. BRYANT stated 
thl3 action was taken merely as a protest against the 
policies of the KENNEDY administration. He stated that v -^ ; ''.VsA 
while he strongly opposed everything the present Government^A* 
had done he certainly considered the assassination was' a ^¥^yf: 
terrible thing and he would never have been connected with v, 
anyone who approved such a crime, BRYANT stated he thought ^ , 
the only proper way to oppose any administration was through 
the ballot box. ' 

BRYANT stated he had never heard of any person 'A 
from Illinois having been in Houston during the above period ' 
in connection with any type of aerial display, that he had 
negotiated with no one other than the Pasadena firm in con- 
nection v/ith this matter, and he knew of no organization in 
the Houston area which had even considered underwriting such 
a demonstration. . ,/,■ '■ 

Mr. BRYANT added that no human being in his pres- 
ence had ever said anything concerning any plan or scheme 
to raise money for the assassination of any Government 
official, and he had neither participated in nor heard •' 
about any plan whatever for the assassination of any official.

to quiet MlCILAUD, but MICHAUD told the doctor that he did not 
think that the doctor was capable of taking care of his injuries^; 
which consisted of cuts and bruises on the head and scalp, from *^ V H£ 
barbed wire. Dr. SANELLA thereupon stated, "I don’t knew whyjvfrtjj

On thzeo occasions. Do was diagnosed by the hospital as suffering 
/from schizophrenia with paranoid tendencies, vicious, clever/.^ C- _| 
convincing'; psychopathic liar, and as having great ability to v r | 
threaten people in such ways so that they make concessions 
him. He was originally committed on March 22, 1956, by the ,;V. 1 . .^ 
Third District Court. Salt Lake City, Utah, on aa emergency 
basis. On April 28, 1956, he was committed again for. indefinite 
period by the Fourth District Court, Prove, Utah. On Hay 15, *' fi? 
1956, he was released to the Veterans Administratioa Hospital, 

Salt Lake City. On February 2, I960, he was committed from the ; 
Sixth District Court, Richfield, Utah, for thirty days or until L ^ 
his mental condition was such that he could be released. He “V l •; 
was released on a writ of habeas corpus on September 30, I960,* —1 } 
: \on the ground of a technicality in commitment papers 3 ^ 

'* - : While in the hospital, MICHAUD alleged homosexuality |'- 

’ on the part of a Kane County official, Kanab, Utah. He later y ; 
admitted to the hospital that this charge against the official* -v 
was false. He was charged with perjury in Kane County, buty V^V' 
this charge was dismissed because of his mental condition. O' 

yy.;/:.. 

In connection with MlCHAUD's release on habeas corpus; 
on September 30, 1960, on the grounds of a technicality in ' • y ; 
commitment papers, MICHAUD filed suit against the Superintendent 
of the State Hospital in Federal Court and received $700.00, which 

* was paid by the state. This award was due to an error in the ; ‘ < 

• commitment papers, since the court ruled it was not a formal 1 
commitment under Utah State Law. - V ' ' ~'

The following investigation was conducted by SA 
FRED J. BASSETT: . 

AT BUTTE, MOI/TANA V * V^',’v 

On December 8, 19&3, JOSEPH P. MONAHAN, attorney. 
at_lav/j.. Butte, Montana, .and former Congressman for the . ru , :; 
Western District of Montana, with residence ‘address’ of •. ; ; 

2218 Elm Street, Butte, advised he had some information he 
believed of utmost importance concerning the assassination 
of the late President. He is sure the information which he 
has concerning this matter came through Divine Guidance* 

MONAHAN stated he is certain the assassination of 
President KENNEDY and also the racial problem of the United 
States was, and is. Communist inspired. He believes the • 
racial problem and also the assassination dates back to the 
_1_" HARRY DEXTERtftfHITE incident, occurring during the EXSENHOWJSR 
Administration." He stated that WHITE did arrange for various 
"monetary plates" to be stolen from the U. S. Treasury and 
they were subsequently turned over to Russia. These plates 
are now being used to print American currency, which is being . 
deposited in various banks in Switzerland and the money is . 
being used to foster unrest in the United States. He stated 
that a book entitled "The Federal Reserve Corporation or 42 
Years of Subversion in 100 Acts" will qualify his statements. 

MONAHAN stated he is certain the sinking of the U. S, 
Submarine Thresher was not due to mechanical failure, but 
believes this submarine was captured by Russian trawlers and 
some key personal of the United States, having knowledge of 
the polaris missile program, were kidnaped and the submarine 
•then deliberately sunk to cover the kidnaping. He said he 
: believe3 this because the Russians do not have a missilewith 
‘the polarl3 capability and are in dire need of the knowledge 
* of its construction and functions.

MONAHAN added he believes the matter of the "TFX" j ,r 

Aircraft Contract was also Communist Inspired to prevent the - ' 

United States from constructing this type of aircraft and 
the intervention by President KENNEDY in this matter wa3 < r ' / 

partly the reason for his assassination. 

MONAHAN advised that he has no knowledge of the 
identity or any information concerning LEE HARVEY OSWALD, > 
but believes OSWALD* s assassin, JACK RUBY, is, in fact, , • - . 

"SERGEmJBENSTEIN,' 1 who was allegedly killed several years 
ago. lie stated history reflects that RUBENSTEIN was to be 
deported and he believes that a gang, probably the "Cosa 
Nostra,” arranged to have a body planted, reflecting 
RUBENSTEIN’s death, when, in fact, he still lives and is 
JACK RUBY. . • ■ . -

that particular evening, the exact date of which he could "

man in conversation and during the course of this conversation 
the man was critical of permitting Negroes to have civil- 
rights and v/as also critical of President KENNEDY. During his 
conversation the man said something to the effect that "we do 
not cay much in Texas but v:e take care of things in our omi 
way." RICARDO said that the man in making this comment was 
referring to the civil rights issue but now in view of the > '

would report, to the right person, what she and another 
friend viewed on TV after the assassination of President 
Kennedy. 

"She thinks that the film they saw had been taken ; 

by someone other than from the press. It showed the 

President's car in front of the School Book Depository V 
Building and, after the shots were fired, two men 
running from the rear left side of the building into 
a lane or alley. One of these men removed his coat 
and threw it into some shrubbery. The second man wore 
a dark suit but neither of these men appeared to be 
policemen. Seconds later, they both disappeared from 
view. v 


"it is my friend's belief that if this film were : - 
rerun and that portion enlarged which showed the two men 
running, there is a very strong possibility that one , 
or both men could be identified. Both she and her . 
friend have asked over a hundred people who saw the ' ; " 
same film on TV but none of them saw what they did, * 
possibly because of all the confusion and excitement 
in the foreground. 

"Knowing how extraordinarily thorough your agents 
are, in all probability they already have this informa-

further in regard to the TV Channel, the date and time 
the film was shown on TV in Los Angeles, I refer you

On November 23, 196j,~ the ' ds^rorx<5wing~tKe assassina-

the School Depository Building immediately after the President v : 
was shot. , ,, .. r . v . . •. ^ 

. At about 1 PM to 2 PM, watching either Los Angeles 

Channel 2 or Channel 4, she observed pictures of the President 
in his car, holding his right hand to his head, with a man in 
the front seat turning to the right, showing his white shirt. ' ' ‘ 
The President’s car then drove off rapidly. Immediately 
following this picture, the television showed the School 
Depository Building and she observed two men, one behind the \ • 

other, running from behind the building to the left, and down 
an alley or street out of view. The man in front, the shorter 
of the two, threw what appeared to be a tan or brown jacket into 
a bush as he ran away, followed by the second man, who appeared 
to be accompanying the first man, not chasing him. 

In subsequent televisin coverage of the assassination, 
she has never been able to observe this scene.

She recalled that immediately following the shooting 
of the President, the picture shifted to the School Depository 
Building, and she observed two men apparently running from the 
rear of this building, around a tree and out of sight. The r 
man in front, believed to be a short white man, threw his coat 
or Jacket away as he ran. The taller man, dark complexioned, 
but believed to be a white man, appeared to be chasing the 
shorter man. She did not see any weapons displayed, and has

then told him that her exact weight Is 130 pounds, 

Mrs • OWEN stated that at first she thought the 
caller was Father WELLMEIER since her husband at first

•jfcstced the caller if it was Father WELIMEIER, but that the 
caller did not give her a reply. Mrs. OWEN stated that she

of a master tape recording all programs transmitted by MBS y^£;- r -^ 
on November 23 and 24, 1963. 

WARREN stated this tape does not contain time 
checks, therefore, it would be impossible to pinpoint the 
exact time a specific item was broadcast; however, he said • 

an educated estimate could be made. 

WARRJIJ informed he would make this tape available for 
review at the MBS studios, if such were desired. ;^ v , . v 

WARR£N advised a log is normally maintained recording 
any interruptions of broadcasts. He said the logs reflect the 
time of the interruption and reason therefore; however, he 
stated these logs are usually not kept accurately during 
"pressure" periods such as that immediately follo\*ing the 
assassination of President KENNEDY. 

WARREN states the log reflecting any interruptions 
during November 23 and 24, 19C3 would be maintained by JOSEPH

LOUIS C.'&ECGIO, Studio S u pervisor,, Mutual Br oadrJ^^^^ 
cist Ing Sys tern, Sheraton JParlu Ho telfe made available varlousl^^^- 
tapes recording broadcasts of the Mutual Broadcasting System 
(MBS) on November 23 and 24, 1963. REGGIO advised these tapes 
are records of broadcasts of the various presentations of MBS 
regarding the assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY. 

He said these tapes do not record various musical presents- -v?^ 
tlons that were broadcast during the four days on which 
special programs were offered. 

A review of the material recorded on spool number 17 
disclosed this tape pertains to broadcasts made between 
4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on November 23, 1963. Spool number 18 
Is a recording of broadcasts made after 8:00 p.m. on November 
23, 1964. This spool (number 18) begins with a newscast at v 
8:00 p.m., which was followed by a twenty-five minute special ' 
program. REGGIO advised both the newscast and the special 
program originated In MBS studios In New York City. 


V A review of material on spool number 26, recorded 

* on November 24, 1963, determined that an Interruption 

occurred In a broadcast that was being made shortly after 
8:00 p.m. on November 24, 1963. This broadcast that was 
being transmitted was a representation cf a program that was 
originally broadcast at 5:05 p.m. on November 24, 1963. The 
broadcast was a conversation between news commentator GUY 
WALLACE of MBS In New York City and BOB JETT, who Is a com- 
; mentator associated with radio station WRR, Dallas, Texas, 

an MBS affiliate. The conversation pertained to the various ? 
i events that occurred following the shooting of LEE HARVEY 

OSWALD. _y ^ 

This program was interrupted when a direct broad-. 


cast from the Capitol Rotunda pre-empted the transmission 
facilities. The broadcast from the Rotunda reported the visit

of Mrs. KENNEDY to the area where President KENNEDY* s body I 

was then located. \ : • , 



REGGIO approximated the times of the various y;;- 

broadcasts that were reviewed on the basis of programs that 
were transmitted and taped. ; ' V;' v-;': v ..y 

It Is noted no taped broadcast was found that meets 
the description of that furnished by EDWARD POST. The only 
Interruption of a broadcast, made around 8:00 p.m. on 
November 23 or 24, 1963, Is that located and reported above.

*■''* JAMES PAUX^SMXTH , aged 25, 940 Jerri Lan e, Be dford^ 
Texas, telephone number BU 2-1269, furnished the following Kfef? 
information* . - , : vV:;?:..: - 4 '. 




r^lf >/ 0 V-^SMITH was bor n i n Dallas, Texas , jon December _31^% 
_19-38..., He vent"to school' up~until~ the ninth grade. He has - 
suffered from motor epilepsy since 1956. He has taken 
medicine for this ailment and at the present time takes six 
tablets a. day to prevent an epileptic seizure. 


SMITH stays at home all the time and watches .. 
television and also tries to read the paper. He said he had ,,’ 4 / 
trouble in reading some of the articles in the paper. He has 
watched pictures on television about the KENNEDY assassination, 
and the way he figures it out, there were about five or six 
shots fired. He does not have any concrete information or 
facts to back up his thoughts in working out Just how KENNEDY 
was shot. He believes that OSWALD fired one shot from the 
Texas School Book Depository Building with his rifle and hit 
KENNEDY. Across the side street there is another brick 
building and JACK RUBY was in this building and fired another 
rifle and hit KENNEDY with this rifle. There was also a 
Secret Service man in the car with KENNEDY and CONNALLY and 
this Secret Service man shot KENNEDY in the 6 ide. The car was 
approaching an underpass and there was someone on top of this 
overpass that fired two shots into the automobile'. He believes 
one or two of these shots are the ones that hit Governor 
CONNALLY. -• 


SMITH believes that some cameraman with WBAP might have 
had something to do with it as he saw a man showing a film on r. 
WBAP which was all about the assassination. He did not have 
any facts to back up this information. 

SMITH believes that more than one person was involved 
in* the shooting and, toward the end of the interview, he made 
. the statement, that NIXON was behind the whole thing. He re- 
called that/ NIXON and KENNEDY had some debates and NIXON was

"Dear’ Sir: 


Wl£2£l 


I would like to Inform you that I know a man here •?-' 
who came back from Texas a few days before the president 
was assasinated and advocated that a groupe of people would 
kill the gresident while in Texas. Also that a groupe of 
people there in Alabama cheered the death of the president, 

I regret very much that I didn't learn this until*' the 
moment the news came that the jgresident was Dead. These 
people let out and made many remarks about it, therefore, 

I am of the opinion some the people here are connected 
with those in Texas in the ass asl nation. 

As the conditions exist I am not able to come to 
your office. If you would like to discuss this with me 
pleas_ let me know or hear from you at your earliest XX 
con vienanc e. 

I seriously would like to help find all that are 
involved in his murder. 

' Sincerely yours 

Louis B. Moody " ^ 

MOODY was located on December 16, 1963, and further . 
advised as follows: . 

He advised that the man to whom he referred as having 
returned from Texas a few days before the President was assassi- 
nated was one ROBERT TEAL, Route 3, Blountsville, Alabama. He 
advised he believed that TEAL is a member of the Teamsters Union 
in the United Mine Workers Union and that he, MOODY, could not 
recall TEAL's exact words except that MOODY claims TEAL made ' " 
some statement that he and his family were glad the Presidential^

was killed. He advised that he did not know what group TEAL 
was referring to as having advocated the killing of the President 
and stated TEAL would have to furnish this information if he ^ 
WOUld. 

During the interview with MOODY, he kept getting off > 
the subject of the interview and kept wanting to talk about ■> 
all of the trouble the United Mine Workers Union had given him JV 
•and repeatedly stated he was certain TEAL was a member of the 
Union and that TEAL had kept him from working in the past and 
from mining coal in this area. 

MOODY was unable to furnish the names of any of the 
persons in this area connected with anyone in Texas as regards 
the assassination of the President. He stated he felt that 
the United States Senators, U. S. Representatives, Alabama 
State Legislators, and other high officials were in "cahoots" 
with those in Texas that killed the President. He was unable 
to give any reason for this other than his own suspicions.

advised that he did not have to make any statement; that any 
statement he did make could be used in a court of law against 
him, and that he had the right to consult an attorney prior 
to making a statement. ■ • 


After being advised of the identity of interviewing 
Agent, -TEAL advised that he knew why the Agent was there and 
that it was concerning a statement he had made just prior to * 

* President KENNEDY going to Texas, just before he was assassi- i 

nated. TEAL advised he had worked at construction work for 
several months in Texas, particularly around the Dallas-Fort 
Worth area. He stated, however, that he returned from Texas \:Vf 
in April, 1963, and has not been back to Texas since that time. 


He advised he was around a group of persons picking 
cotton in the Blountsville, Alabama, area in November, 1963, 
when the subject came up about President KENNEDY going to Texas. 
He said he made the statement in front of several persons to 
the effect that "KENNEDY had better watch out in Texas, as 
those people down there are fed up with him and don't like 
niggers anyway." He stated what he meant was that after having 
lived in Texas a short period of time he found that most of 
the people he was around or came in contact with did not want 
integration and did not like the President because of his Civil 
Rights stand. He stated that he, personally, has no first- 
hand knowledge of the assassination. He further stated that 
his* family had been accused by LOUIS MOODY of cheering when 
the President had been killed. 


TEAL advised he would like to get this straightened 
out and related that on the date of the assassination someone 
told him about the shooting of the President and he replied, 
"That was quite a joke", as he thought someone was just kidding 
with him. He stated he did not believe this and passed it off 
as a joke until later in the afternoon when he heard the news 
on the radio. 

• ... ’ • - 

TEAL stated he regretted that there had been a mis- 
. understanding in this matter.

BRANIFF AIRLINES, FROM 
HOUSTON TO DALLAS, TEXAS, 

NOVEMBER 21, 1963 

CORNELIUSxLennqn , 108 Spruce S treet, Watertown, 
Massachusetts, advised SA FREDERICK M. CONNORS of the 
Boston Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on 
November 22, 1963, that he was on Flight #20, Braniff 
Airlines, from Houston, Texas, on November 21, 1963. , . ^ 

A male individual who boarded the flight at Houston 
and departed at Dallas, Texas, occupying seat 15-C, 
indicated his displeasure with the President. He 
commented that he was not liked and that they were 
concerned about the President's welfare during his visit 
to Texas. He said it was obvious there was concern as 
the Vice President was coming to Texas on a separate 
flight. 

The occupant of seat 15-C is described as a 
White male, fifty-five to sixty years of age, five feet 
ten inches in height, weighing one hundred sixty pounds, 
with grey hair. This individual did not make any specific 
threats, but simply indicated his dislike for the President.

Deputy Sheriff found an old pistol in her pocketbook# As the V-> 
result of the finding of this weapon, she received considerable

this was an old gun which was unloaded, which she had placed in

; V CARLIN eald eh« kno wa there are several people living V\f’ 

In Fort Worth at the present time, or who have lived in Fort Worth - 
in the past* who regard her as an enemy and she felt any one of 
those persona could have written the type letter which was written 
to JACK RUBY postmarked December 3, 1963, at Fort Worth, Texas. - 
CARLIN said her best suspect would be an individual by the name 
of JERRY* HARRIS BUNKER, whom she and her husband suspect as having 
.made several telephone calls to the CARLIN residence within the 
past few weeks attempting to cause trouble between the CARLINS. 

CARLIN said she and BRUCE CARLIN have received seven 
or eight of these calls and, in some instances, the caller has y 
impersonated a woman's voice in talking with BRUCE CARLIN, at 
which time the person made many false claims against the reputa- 
tion of 1AREN in trying to causa friction between KAREN and her 
husband. 


CARLIN said she is unable to account for the personal 
dislike many persons have for her, except she had "taken* the 
boyfriends of several other girls which has lead to considerable 
Jealousy on the part of these girls. — — 

CARLIN continued anofchep parson who may have written 
such a letter would be one JQY^ALS, who was recently married, 
and is four months pregLYnt. PALE is located somewhere in the 
State of Minnesota at the present time, possibly Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. CARLXN said she believed DALE was writing to JACK 
RUBY at one time, although she had no reason to believe there 
was any animosity between TALE end JACK ^£UBY. 

j&y.- 

She stated another individual who may have written 
this letter would be one "FAT^jkiPjTfOOB" who operates a tavern 
in Fort Worth known as the "CelXar.* CARLIN said KIRKWOOD 
has a shady reputation JLn Fort Worth and she would not put it 
pbst KIRKWOOD to write such a letter, although she did not know 
of any animosity between KIRKWOOD and RUBY. '

ently someone is jealous of his relationship with I&RBN CAkLiN 
and someone has a strong desire to cause trouble for them, or 
to cause friction between them. CARLIN said his best suspect 
in regard to the telephone calls is a co-worker of his by the 
name of JERRY HARRIS BUNKER, vho formerly dated KAREN CARLIN. 

CARLIN said BUNKER was observed in close proximity to a telephone 
booth on one occasion ehortly after KAREN CARLIN had received 
one of these telephone calls, and there was every lndlcjtlo^ • 
BUNKER had made the call. CARLIN said he has heard soma mutual 
friends state BUNKER is an "odd individual." 


CARLIN said that, with the exception of JERRY BUNKER, 
he would not know anyone else who might hava written a letter 
to JACK RUBY at the Dallas County Jail from Fort Worth, Texas, 
postmarked December 3, 1963.

r' Sheriff J. E. (BlLL^fecKER, Dallas County Sheriff , r* &? 
Office/ advised he did not desire JACK RUBY be Interviewed 
regarding a letter directed to him at the Dallas County Jail,t£vi 
which letter was postmarked December 3, 1363. Sheriff DECKER 
explained that, because of inter.ss newspaper coverage of th9% : -& 
activities of JACK RUBY in cocmection with his impending trial - 
at Dallas for the murder of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, accused assassin 
of former President JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY, he did-not feel 
such interview should be conducted. 


Sheriff DECKER said he felt the letter directed to 
JACK RUBY on December 3, 1963, frcm Fort Worth was sent as a 
"prank" and he did not feel it warranted the hazard of undue 
publicity which might result from an interview with RUBY. 
Sheriff DECKER stated that in the event newspapermen learned 
of the letter he felt the matter could be "blown out of pro- 
portion* and no advantage would be served to anyone. 


Sheriff DECKER stated he did not desire RUBY be 
contacted and Interviewed as to the possible identity of the 
person or persons who may have been responsible for writing 
this letter for reasons stated above. Sheriff DECKER further 
advised he has not shown the letter to RUBY for the reasons 
stated above, and he did not intend showing the letter to RJJBY 
since he has considered the matter a "prank" from the outset and 
his belief has been borne out by the failure of person or persons 
to carry out the threat set forth In the letter that "...we will 
be there the 9th." * 


DECKER stated that, if at all pcselble, he did not 
da s Ire any further action be taken in this matte/ for the reasons 
he stated above. 

Sheriff DECKER pointed cut numerous "prank" letters 
have been received by law enforcement agencies in Dallas follow- 
ing the assassination of President KENNEDY, and he felt this is 
Just one more of the "prank" letters which have been received.

RE: 


VANDALISM IN SCHOOLS 
IN HOUSTON AREA 


The following investigation was conducted by 
SA GRAHAM W. KITCKEL: 


On November 27, 19^3, Mr. GERALDxJONES , Pjclrmipal^- 
Ralph .Anderson. Elementary School , 57.27 Lucrington , . Houston,. 
Texas, advised that,’* "in 'light of "the Presidents assassina- 
tion, he thought the following information should be made 
available. He stated that .three separate incidents, all 
of which are similar in nature, took place at the above - 
school. He stated that between Friday evening, November 22, 
1963 , and Sunday morning, November 24, 1963, American flags, 
in the school were tom down. He stated the flags were : . 
again torn down on Sunday afternoon, November 24, 1963, and 
on this occasion they were cut into ribbons. Again, be- 
tween Monday evening and Tuesday morning, November 26, 1963,- 
they were tom down and were stained with ink and duplicator 
liquids. 


Fir. JONES said he could supply no additional in- 
formation concerning the reasons or the persons involved in 
the commission of these acts.- 


The Houston Press for November 27, 1963, contained 
and article entitled "Vandals Desecrate Flag, Constitution*" 
This article set out that vandals apparently deliberately 
desecrated every American flag and a framed copy of the ; 
United States Constitution in three separate break-in 3 at 
the Ralph Anderson Elementary School in the Westbury Addi- ’ 
tion of Houston, Texas, 


■ ■■■" ( GERALD JONES, Principal of the school, is reported 

as saying that this seems to be an act of anti-Americanism. 
,The flag of the United States and the state flag of Texas 
were targets throughout the school in these acts of desecra- 


JONES is further reported to have.. . * stated ' 
that a framed copy of the Constitution of the United States' 

was torn f rom t he wal l of the school^ library and had beet

battered against furniture, thrown on the floor, stomped ’ 
upon, and ripped into threads. - ;; ; 

JONES stated every one Of the eight American flags 
hanging in the school* s classrooms had been torn down, • ' 

thrown “to the floor, and some had been smeared with paint. 

In addition to the reviling of the flags, the school was 
turned into turmoil by the vandals, v/ho wrote obscene words 
across the walls, and a great number of books were pulled 
from cases and thrown about the building in wild disorder.’! 
The initials "K.C.S." were scribbled on the floors, in lip- 
stick. The clock in the principal* s office was pried from 
the walls, and its parts strewn about the office. Desks 
were ransacked and ink poured on vast amounts of paper. 

Fire extinguishers were turned upside down and their chemi- 
cals emptied on the floors, walls and ceilings and on books. 

JONES was reported to have stated that it is 
the desecration of the flags and the Constitution that hurts 
so deeply. It is apparent, he said, that we have to do a 
better Job of instilling some of the basic American con- 
certs in our young people than we have done in the past. 

The article advised that Juvenile Division Captain 
C. P, ANDERSON is investigating this matter and stated that 
the initials "K.C.S," have also been painted outside of a 
Houston Police Substation in the general area of the Ander- 1 
son Elementary School and on the exterior of the Johnson ■ ■■}/ 
Junior High School in the same general area. *.■■■■■; 

Officer T. J. HOLLINGSHEAD is reported to have 
stated that the initials "K.C.S." stand for "King Cutters," 
reportedly the mark of a gang of youths between the ages of 
14 and 16. ; • 

The Houston Post for November 28, 1953, carried 
An article entitled "Less Than Fifteen Students Cheered, 
Landrum Says." Thi3 article stated that Dr. H. M .VL’Andrum. 
^A r A^tendent_of the Spring Branch S chooTTH gttfictT Had' " - ' 
commented that He 'only cheers"‘repbrted to ‘his'*bffice came-^vf:

that suddenly changing from prejudice to sorrow may be

had been in Guatemala instructing troops down there and iyyy 
that he had pulled out a week or two prior to the Bay of 
Pigs invasion and had net participated in the invasion. 

HATHCOCK did not see VJATLEY again until about - f 
seven~or eight months ago when he came to HATHCOCK 1 s office 
with two other men, all three of whom were wearing green 
fatigues and one of the men was wearing a "mohawk" hair ’• -

HATHCftCK still had the rifle. HATHCOCK told him that he had \ 

given the rifle to HALL for $50 and this seemed to irritate 1 

PATRICK to some extent. Since then HATHCOCK has sent the ' \ 

receipt he received from HALL for the $50 to PATRICK [ 

convince him that he had returned the rifle. . ? 

On the day HALL retrieved the rifle, he sold • 

him a Bolex Motion Picture Camera with telephoto lens 
which was then the property of HATHCOCK. HALL paid by 
two checks - one drawn on the Citizens Bank on the account ^ j 
of the Committee to Free Cuba in the amount of $350 and 
another in the amount of $150 on the account of a resident . 
of La Habra. HATHCOCK gave HALL back $100. ^ ■ 

HATHCOCK advised both PATRICK and HALL are vio- :;>•••-. v> ' 
lently anti -communist and anti-Castro and they both told 
him they fought in the mountains with Castro in Cuba, 
however, fell out with him after the revolution. LORENZO 
told HATHCOCK he spent seven months in prison in Cuba, 
however, eventually got back to the United States. PATRICK 
stated that he fell out with Castro and eventually got back 
to the United States. 

(HATHCOCK has Zerox copies of newspaper articles 
from Florida in his office concerning the anti-Castro troops 
training there and PATRICK’S picture appears as one of the 
anti-Castro troops). 

PATRICK, when in Los Angeles, had an address of 
1209 South Atlantic, Alhambra, (Atlantic Radio & TV), 
telephone number AT 1-6421* and an address of in care of 
HOV/ARD K. DAVIS, 3350 N.W. l8th Terrace, Miami, Florida, r 
telephone number NE 4-1373* 

It is HATHCOCK’ s information that DAVIS was = 

Castro’s personal pilot and also a close friend of DICK 
WATLEY.

His mother still lives there, and he visited her a couple of 
weeks before Christmas 1963. He has a young brother, GEORGE '^01 
PATRICK WYLLIE, who resides at home. The Major said he did 
not see his brother, “PAT," on his last trip home; however, 
this was just a few days after the assassination of President 
KENNEDY in Dallas and "Naturally, everybody was talking about." v 
Major WYLLIE said that he had been stationed in the Canal Z one 
wh9n during 1963 President KENNEDY made a trip there and WYLLtBV 
had been part of the Army Security Guard at that time. "T/;'

— ■- Major WYLUE said he personally has no first hand 

information of any sort about the assassination of the Presi- 
dent or any of the following events. He did say that the papers 
had been full of articles and some speculated as to the fact 
that OSWALD might have been trying to kill Governor CONNALLY, 
because CO."FlLLY had been Secretary of the Navy when OSWALD 
tried to get an honorable discharge. Major WYLLIE may have said 
to his mother that "no one knows for sure who OSWALD wanted to 
kill." 


Major WYLLIE was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, from 
September 1961 to September 1962 but related that he spent 99 : 
per cent of his time on the base and denied that he had related 
any information about gambling operations in that area to any of 
his superiors or even learned of any such operations. 

According to Major WYLLIE , "CUE" HOOPER was a :-v ; / 
"local character" in Cleveland, Tenn. HOOFER was rumored 
to be a gambler and bootlegger and was said to have killed 
at least one man personally and numerous others through his 
rotten bootleg whiskey. CUE HOOPER was murdered by his own 
son about seven or eight years ago.

latent prints on cartons near where Oswald fired the assassi* 
nation shots. The most recent request indicated that all

have necessitated the taking of major case prints of all 
Texas School Book Depository Building (TSBD) employees, 

Roy 8. Truly, Warehouse Superintendent, of the TSBD when / 
advised of this procedure strongly objected and requested •'f 'v 
.the taking of prints be limited to those employees who would/ 
have had occasion to handle the cartons. Bureau letter V 
0-16-64, to the Commission pointed out Truly’s objections' 
and indicated we would not go beyond this point unless 
advised to the contrary by the Commission, 

Dallas by airtel 6-16-64, submitted a letterhead-

her interpretation of the various aspects of the^a^^SfiXnatlftP^ 
of President ; KENNEDY and the results of her alleged personal 
~rhvestTgatibn“iht6 this matter. She has written communications 
which are disrespectful to the Director, criticizing the quality 
and typo of inquiry made into this matter by the Bureau. She 
has been insulting and highly disrespectful to an Agent who has 
talked to her in the past. •••*-, :• 


There is no indication that her husband, MARK £. MARTIN, 
participates with her in her alleged Investigations, or that /V 
he assists in tho various communications sort out by her. He.isfJIX- 
reportedly tho manager of a large grain storage facility located' 
in the vicinity of Honiny, Okla. . 




The Bureau -has directed Oklahoma City and Dallas to continue

it bis office. In M^y BARKER*s office was a television monitor 
?nd BARKER explained It was set on a closed-circuit channel and ' -., 

!hat In a few moments the Agents could observe the removal of 
LEE HARVEY OSWALD from the Dallas City Jail to the Dallas County *■ 

Jail via this closed-circuit television. •. *.* • -V 

After observing a man later Identified as JACK L. RUBY 

choot OSWALD In the basement of the City Hall, and within 30 seconds 

of the shooting, SA BARRETT telephonically reported what he and 
?A LEE had observed via television to Special Agent in Charge J. GORDON 
"HANKLIN at the Dallas FBI Office. SAC SHANKLIN has advised SAs BARRETT 
and LEE that immediately upon receiving their report he placed a 
telephone call via direct dialing to FBI Headquarters In Washington, 

D. C., telephone No. Executive 3-7100, to report the incident. «. 

After telephonically reporting the incident to SAC SHANKLIN, 

‘'As BARRETT and LEE made notes of what they had observed to be used - . 
later In the dictation of a report of the matter. Preparation of 
the notes took place about 8 to 10 minutes after the shooting and 
the Agents had to approximate the time of the shooting as 11:25 a.m. 

This approximation was based on estimation of time lapse and the 
Agents' own personal wrlstwatches, the accuracy of which is unknown.

,*'X-:ri‘On November 24, 1963, SAa IVAN a LEE and ROBERT M. BARRETT £2^ 
were contacting EDDIE BARKER, Director of KRLD-TV and Radio News, 
at his office. In Mr. BARKER'S office was a television monitor 
and BARKER explained It was set on a closed-circuit channel and C 

that in a few moments the Agents could observe the removal of - v* 

LEE HARVEY OSWALD from the Dallas City Jail to the Dallas County *7 
Jail via this closed-circuit television. 


After observing a man later identified as JACK L. RUBY /..Cv 

shoot OSWALD in the basement of the City Hall, and within 30 seconds j. 
of the shooting, SA BARRETT telephonlcally reported what he and 
SA LEE had observed via television to Special Agent in Charge J. GORDON 
SHANKLIN at the Dallas FBI Office. SAC SHANKLIN has advised SAs BARRETT 
and LEE that immediately upon receiving their report he placed a 
telephone call via direct dialing to FBI Headquarters in Washington, - 
D. C., telephone No. Executive 3-7100, to report the incident. ; v 

After telephonlcally reporting the incident to SAC SHANKLIN, 

SAs BARRETT and LEE made notes of what they had observed to be used • 
later in the dictation of a report of the matter. Preparation of 
the notes took place about 8 to 10 minutes after the shooting and 
the Agents had to approximate the time of the shooting as 11:25 a.m. 

This approximation was based on estimation of time lapse and the 
Agents' own personal wristwatches, the accuracy of which is unknown. .

U. S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT 
ARTICLE 6/8/64 REGARDING - 
ASSASSINATION “ 



St’BJtCT: 

/ ; I 

^ |. The current issue of U. S. News and World Report, page 38, carries a 

story that a 33-ycar-old^Jnpanese investigator, agent Sassa, joined quietly with the FBI 
:;i its investigation of the assassinat ion of President Kennedy. 

; , • *• * ■ *■'*-" "• . Jj' h If /* /' ■> • -V~/- 

This article concerning the assassination contains several other minor 

discrepancies and, to the FBI's benefit, strongly hits at the irresponsible accounts of 
the assassination written by Thomas Buchanan. * ; ;• t 1 
, ■ ■ - \ v ' ~ A tV v ''..4 > 

I talked to Dave Lav/rence regarding the article's assertion that the ' 
Japanese investigator Sassa worked with the FBI in its investigation. Mr. Lawrence .?■ 
•enlized, of course, that this was completely inaccurate and said that Japanese officials 
.id talked to Associated Press (AP) and pointed out that Sassa was not working with the 
31. Mr. Lawrence said to fully clarify the matter he was contacting both AP and -- 
nited Press International (UPI) relative to this inaccuracy. - 7 .-v,- 

Both AP and UPI have contacted my office regarding the U. S. News and 
•Vorld Report story. We **no commented” the matter and indicated privately to them 
hat they should be alert for the Japanese denial and Mr. Lawrence's denial that Sassa 
had joined in the FBI’s official assassination inquiry. These clarifying statements by 
Japanese officials and by Mr. Lawrence should handle the matter effectively. ^

tn January, (be Japanese Government 
MvrrJly assigned a sped;.! security agent 
am fisc Japanese national police to join 
.uk - fly with the American FBI ic its in* 
• esrigation of the assassination of Preif- 
kiit Kennedy. 

j The agent was 33-year -old Atsuyukt 
I have Just spent four hours yith 
-T^n.r Sassa and Kuniyasu Tsuchida, db 
irvtor of the Tokyo metropolitan police 
guard division. 

Only one men. U may talc more 
than Use Warren Commission report to 
nsiviiKC many people that die assassina- 
:k*o was not part of a larger conspiracy. 
The official report to the Japanese Cov- 
vnuociit, however, bolds that President 
Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey 
Oswald and that it was the "impulsive 
act" of tlut one man. 

Said agent Sassa: "President Kennedy 
was hit by a steel-jacketed lifgh-pow* 
«*rid bullet. It hit tl*e back of the sleuth 
pushing ulie^l a skull fragment Clio 
M/e of a quojicr througSi thu tide of hit 
- - . - - ' - 
3 “A sliver off d*e bullet came east of 
the *cv.ir left ol the nccl, giving rise to 
sf ^ulaiion that ft w*s from a shot 
ft* I; i.%#m In fiont of d.i car.* 

continued: “Presk-'ent Kennedy 
was craJ before he arrived ut the hospi- 
tal. If he hwd not been 4 President, no 
doctor would have tried an operation.* 
Then why was It attempted? "There 
was one chance in a million be could be 
revived," Sassa said. 

"There have been error two exam- 


ples of similar head Injuries resulting 
from auto accidents in which flic vic- 
tims miraculously survived. So the Op- 
eration was carried out for three reasons: 
*A miracle dunce to revive the 
President f - 9 t t ( C l 

"To make use 6f lime— an hour or 
morc-to ensure the safety and do* 
parture from tire area of Vice Presi- 
dent Johnson. 

“To permit last rites of the Cath- 
olic Clnirch to be carried out before 
an official death was recorded.* 
fn refutation — . At this point, Sassa 
tore Into wliat he called the "emotion- 
ally fauguiative spcciilattonriof Ameri- 
can expatriate writer TtromasV/pchanan, 
which are being 'widely-' cfrculatod In 
Asia. Buchanan has theorized that Os- 
wald and Jack Ruby were hirelings of* 
wealthy U. S- right-wing interests who 
connived with tlr*> Dallas police to carry 
out (lie assassination. {**.-• 9 f 

Refuting lludi.iiuns tlscories, Sassa re- 
ported, arc iImtw facts: 

“TJk: bullet jiliv.f wound on the Fieri- 
dent's neck lrfi u *>*ar so d on It was 
overbooked at fiisl. Tlau It W.ts tla>U,dd 
It iiiiglit be j:i iit1r;UAt wound (:ufu a 
s!k 4 fired lu li exit of (lie Prcrid*%»:*S car. 
Later, Isowit it, «1*c diver was fo% A on 
flic car flour. *h i«»i:te was traced a* tie 
autopsy. But • vm witlmnt tliat evidct.‘.v, 
to make such a wimod from the front 
tl»e assassin %\mdd have had to lic oa 
(Ire pavcnwfst aln ad of (l»e car. Also his 
sltot would base bad to Dcnetratc the ■ 
front windshi**kljr y //, *// --T’ 

“No shot from a nearby bridge could 
have made Mtdi a hk. : 


"The accusers say that three shots 
cannot be fired from a tclcscopic-sight 
quipped, high-powered rifle in diglitly 
over five seconds. Well, the FBI official- 
ly timed the sliooting as taking over six 
seconds— from 6.5 to 8.8 seconds. Also V 
remember that >ou count after tl»e first 
sliot is squeezed. That means Buchanan V- 
contends two more shots couldnlt be. * 
. fired accurately in about 6 seconds. Do * 
you see (lie psyclmlogical falsification or 
trap fn the Buchanan argument? Any 
marksman can do what was done and 
hit t!*c target. Any nonexpert con do It 
ai«d come close. Remember flic Presl- 
dci. ts car was moving slowly away frimi 
tin; assassin. His telescopic sight oil l!*c 
distaiwe down to about one fourth (4 ¥.% 
aciiiJ length. : " * • : * ' u

with a telescopic siglit Is to let tlie rifir

Oswald: bootings and ho/red. As 
for Oswald, tl)'* a»tiised assassin of

this: 

“OiwaM trarl In preserve a small Rus-

readily divl»-**l anyone wt«o wielded 
authority. Ih* |w.4uldy saw his own fa- 
tier in Preskh nl Ka»n«!y" 

Agent Sas<4 said his report concludes 
that the assassination "was not planned 
much in advance. Oswald apparently 
got the idea after ll*c President s visit to 
Dallas was announced. AH evidence 
points to the shooting as a completely 


Impulsive act. Oswald was tv4 a man 
who could prepare or plan things. lie 
was too unstable** • * > s 

In tlsc words of agent Sassa, that Is ^ 
the core of his official report to the Jap**%

known in the U. S. • ~ : ■; 

On May 2-1 investigators for the War-

tion in Dallas, in order to prove, with 
photographs and other evidence, that the 
bullets fi/cd at the President could have ~ 
come only from the Texas School Book „ 
Depository Building, and not from Is 
front of the car* 

"The Dallas Tunes Hcr^UT said the 
rc-enactmcnt proved conclusively that 
If the bullets had been fired from hi 
front of the car they would have had to 
go through the limousine's windshield 
to hit either the President or Governor 
John ConnaJly who was wounded by one 
of the assassin's bullets. 

Results of the rc-cnactmcnt will be 
part of the report by the Warren Com-

by President Johnson to find and tell aS

prior to the presidents assassination, and the fact that 
Lee Harvey Oswald had prior association In the Bronx, Hew * ,rS Y v :}

On June 22, 1964, a copy of the following quoted ^ 
letter from Mrs. MARK E. MARTIN, Hoininy, Oklahoma, postmarked J 
at Hominy, Oklahoma, June 20, 1964, and hearing a return vrXsg 
address of Box 566, Hominy, Oklahoma, was received hy the -v/-* v

"Dear Mrs. Wests /r >. X 

X •• • 

•The following quote hy Rutt/Paw^e In your REDBOOK 
article is interesting! 'I didn't try to preatih X 
to Lee (Oswald) about right or wrong. I simply 
told him that I was the kind of person Who had 
ever been able to lie ' 


•We wonder JLf this statement was as amusing to Lee 
Oswald as it is to us? In February, 1964, vs - r -r 
traveled to Dallas to talk to Mrs. Paine. During - 
the course of our visit Mrs. Paine told us a number * 
of things DIRECTLY OPPOSED to those she told you. ‘ X 
While we realize that Mrs. Paine was under no obli- 
gation to tell us anything at all, the fact of the 
matter is SHE DID. Therefore, either in her conver- 
sation with us or in her conversation with you, SHE// 
LIED. Does this not negate her self-r6vealing 
statements 'I (am) the kind of person vto has never 
been able to lie?' * r ■>

On 2-28-64, Mrs. Paine was specifically interviewed 
at the request of the Commission concerning her contact 
with Martin. At this time Mrs. Paine who had befriended the 
Oswalds Indicated that during the latter part of January, 1964, X 
or early February, 1964, she had consented to an interview .. : v'- / 
with Martin. Mrs. Paine stated that for approximately two 
hours Martin questioned her regarding all aspects of the 
assassination known to Paine. At this time Mrs. Paine ...'£.VvV/ 
characterized Martin as a "bright nut" who reached certain ' 
conclusions in spite of the evidence. This information 
was furnished to the Commission by Bureau letter dated 3-4-64.

Decenber 18, 1962, for Mandatory release August 7, 1064, • 

with full ter* to expire Decenber 20, 1964, However, there .? 

is a detainer against his in favor of the United States 
Board of Parole; and that on the ternlnatlon of his present, 
sentence, he will remain in custody to serve an additional 
658 days. Be is shown to have been employed fron Hay 1960 
.to October 1960 as self-employed at 401 East Vethvln, Longview, : 

Texas, operating a service station, and from 1955 to 1959 for 
the Magnolia Sales Service as a photographer. The record of 
previous addresses Indicated he resided with his nother fro* r : ■

1958 to 1959 at 9000 Northeast Union Avenue, Portland, ^regodl^^i 'cV 

he resided alone. And from 1956 to 1958, he resided with sis 

wife at 1313 Kings Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida, The Cltfslfl* ^ 

cation Study prepared as to ANDREWS in 1961 indicates that hiw 

arrest history began In early 1955, This being his second pea^l i^v*' 

type commitment, having previously received a Federal sentencs^|^>'y;\ 

for two years and six Months for Transportation of a Female 

Interstate for Immoral Purposes. During this incarceration, ’I 

he served tlse at Tallahassee .Atlanta, and Springfield Id 

Federal institutions. There was no adverse diaclplinaVy 

action at that tioe, however, his adjustment was described 

as marginal. He was transferred from Atlanta to Springfield^^^;^i7 

for observation and for possible tuberculosis condition. - 

The observation was for possible need of psychiatric 

attention. He was further described as a frail individual '■ 

who complained continually about his present situation, and y. 

that he was openly bitter toward the state, and federal . 




authorities and society in general.

these one-dollar hills hack to determine where they " 
came from. He stated that if he still had the origi-

could determine what hanking establishment in Houston 
furnished these hills to his hank. He stated, however 
that this hinder is no longer available. 

Mr. Dudley canvassed the employees of the 
hank who customarily count and handle the money and 
no one was located who had any recollection of having 
seen this money. 

Mr. Dudley further stated that had his 
employees seen the markings on the hills they would 
have withdrawn them from circulation which is 
customary with his hank. 

Set out below are the results of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation Laboratory examination of 
these hills:

he shot Nov. 22, 1963, warn him please." All three 
hills have mustaches drawn on Washington's picture. 

One of the hills has a swastika drawn on Washington’s 
forehead. 

The hand printing on D-230 was compared 
with the material in the Anonymous Letter File hut 
no identification was effected.

an anonymous letter was received at the Bureau on 5-18-64* 
alleging that the writer overheard a conversation in the v : 

Spanish language Indicating knowledge of the assassination mipSp- 
and Implying a threat against the Chief Justice, The writer* 4 ’ 
stated the person making these statements drove a car y. 
bearing Arizona license EZY 958, which was determined to ■ . :r ' <.p-: v- . 
belong to one Arthur G, Imhoff. Imhoff was interviewed 
on 6-17-64 and denied having any knowledge of the assassina- * v : ‘. 
tion or acquaintance with any of the central figures. He H - 
indicated an Interest in extrasensory perception "seers" 
and "mystics." He acknowledger! that he might have talked 
about predictions of the Presidents death made by others, 
but denies making any statements which could be construed 
as a threat. The Chief Justice and the President's 
Commission were immediately advised of the receipt of the 
anonymous letter and were advised we were investigating. 

In view of outcome of interview, no further action appears 
warranted and this should conclude our responsibilities in

report from the readers 

^ ACID POR WARTS 

*Jt noted the statements of Dr, T. 
t Von Dellen on page six of tho 
Mirth, 1963* issue about soaking 
warts in hot water* which does not 
thrays work. 

^When working as an apprentice 
toy in a machine shop many years 
ago, I was troubled by numerous 
warts on my fingers. We had in the 
ihop a five-gallon atone crock filled 
with a mixture of hydrochloric and 
sulphuric acid* used for cleaning 
brass castings. 

> One day 1 took a long wooden 
natch and dipped the end of it about 
one-sixteenth of an inch into the 
mixture, and then carefully touched 
the top (only the top) of a wart with 
the end of the matchstick. I was 
careful that the matchstick was only 
moistened and that there was not 
a drop of acid hanging on the end. 
y In a few days the wart was gone, 
and all the rest went the same way. 
Only one wart should be treated at 
a time, 

^1 did not bury the matchstick with’ 
the head toward the moon— I just 
threw it down tho drain.— -OnW Son* 
nan* Straw Lake, AT, Y % 


along the sidewalk, on our way 
home from the town's only theatre. 
The sun had set just five minutej 
before and the sky was still very 
bright. 

We happened to glance up to 
our right and saw a glowing object 
approaching us at great speed out 
of the northeastern sky. It was a 
fluorescent orange in color and had 
a smooth, metallic appearance. I 
definitely would say that the oV 
ject was a vehicle driven or con* 
trolled by an unknown and superior 
power. 

As it approached, we noticed a 
tail of fire at the rear, tapering 
to a point and trailing off. The fire 
left no smoke, and continued until 
the object came even with us, when 
suddenly it stopped in mid-air about 
25 feet overhead. 

It appeared to be about 25 feet 
in diameter. While in flight it made 
the sound of falling water, but as 
it hovered above us we heard no 
sound at all. We stared, transfixed, 
at the awesome and frightening 
thing. It remained motionless for 
about a minute. Then, as we re- 
sumed walking along the sidewalk, 
it followed us, directly overhead, 
for almost a full block. Again it 
stopped in mid-air, and then, with 
stunning speed, it shot straight up 
at a 90-degree angle, still in a 
horizontal position. It went out of 
sight into a clear sky so quickly 
that we were able to follow it with 
our eyes for only a split-seconds 
just long enough to see the direc- 
tion in which it disappeared. Al- 
though the highway was jammed 
with cars, it appears that we were 
the only persons who saw the ob- 
ject. — Wanda Lockwood, R+orkt**

•MOST ASTOUNDING ARYtCtt* 
The article Print rich Jnrgrm. 
ten and (he Voices o f the Dead, in 
the December issue, is to my mind 
the most astounding article ever 
published — “if true as reported.* 
The problem is that everyone I 
have asked to read the article seems 
to feel it is just so much nonsense. 
If, as reported, voices of the dead 
actually have been taped, then man 
surely must be on the verge of a 
tremendous breakthrough in regard 
to the survival after death question. 

What bothers me is that in this 
article are claims of a world-shale* 
ing order, and the publishers of 
Fatc just report them and let them 
hang with no conclusions as to 
whether they are true or false. I 
wish to have a great deal more 
information about these claims, and 
I am sure Fate has the resources 
to make a searching investigation. 
Can, in fact, the tapes not be faked, 
as claimed by sound expert KjeU 
Stensson? 

True or false, here Is an oppor* 
tunity for a deep and wide investi- 
gation that will create as much 
interest as did the search for Bri* 
dey Murphy several years ago.— 
R. W . Stcinkt, Winnipeg , Manitoba* 
Canada. 

IOTTK VON STRAHL UNlAStlVD 
In the December issue of Fat* 
you mention, rather disparagingly* 
on page 21, a well-known local 
sensitive, Mrs. Lotte von StrahL 
She does not call herself the “Bar- 
oness von Strahl,” and she stresses 
that the newspapers persist .ij 
labeling her with this title, which 
she says she abhors* 

As a result of the publicity giv*® 
her by newspapers, I interviewed 


Report from the readers 


•her and was impressed with her as 
an unusual human being one would 
he delighted to know even if she 
did not have the gift of psychic 
powers. During the interview she 
hold me that during World War II 
^llied Intelligence made use of her 
psychic powers and knowledge of 
graphology to decode messages.—

FROGS WITH RAIN . 7 

Regarding the article by Ray- 
mond Bayless in the February is* t 
»ue — I believe the shrimp did fall 
from the sky! I say this because I 
•aw frogs that came with the rains! 

One minute the ground was dry* 
with nothing stirring. Then came a 
torrent of rain and these minute 
hopping things were everywhere* 
We mistook them for hailstones 
from the way they bounced, but^ 
when the rain stopped and the* 
things kept bouncing, we went out- 
side to look* They were frogs, tiny, - 
emaciated and almost transparent* * 

When we attempted to pick them * 
up, their thin, little bodies clung 
like jelly to our skin. The meadow 
near our house soon was a lake 
and full of frogs, all about the site 
of my thumbnail. The ground was 
so thickly covered with them that 
we could not walk without crushing * 
them, although they tried to jump,,,' 
away. 

The frogs in the meadow-lake 
survived and grew into normal

Mn the park and* iSm their d res*, 
speech and mannersms, I judged 
them to be English. They were look. 
iiUT up into the siy. I did like- 
wise and saw a Jarra cigar-shaped 
object Don ting therv rt had a sort 
of cabin slung beneirh the bag. 

As I watched* I arv a spiral of 
something resembUnp smoke Issue 
from amidships of tb* gondola. The 
smoked increased rap»:> in volume. 
The roar of the stip't engines 
seemed suddenly to ceue. and then 
the dirigible veered fmm its for. 
ward course. I seerr.e: to hear a 
wail coming from the passengers In 
the gondola and trie* of horror 
from watchers on the mund. Then 
the gondola disintegrate! pieces of 
It falling earthward. Stme of the 
passengers or crew scrambled up 
on the inflated bag* but nhe dirigi- 
ble broke in two, with men hanging 
on the two sections of the bag. 
Then what was left of tie gondola 
fell to the ground. 

The images of this spectacular 
disaster were clearly etched on my 
brain* and I still can pirnsro the 
scene I saw at that time. 

I dismissed the experience as a 
dream and plunged into rty daily 
duties. Great was my astorishment 
late the same day, to see is large 
headlines news of the disaster l 
had seen eight hours before 5t hap- 
pened. Details reported in the news- 
paper coincided with those I had 
witnessed. Files of New York and 
other newspapers will confirm my 
story. 

I was so impressed and amaxed 
by the happening that I wrote a de- 
tailed report of it and mailed it to 
the Society for Psychical Research,** 
New York* within a day or two or

it a more accurate designation t» 
this anthology, for the 26 chapters 
deal with such assorted matters at 
witchcraft, dreams, sombies. and 
werewolves, in addition to haunting* 
and apparitions. Although it is %% 
leged that all accounts are tra*. 
documentation varies from excellent 
(notably the sections by R. S. Lam- 
bert) to non-existent; and some of 
the stories in the latter category 
sound like fiction. Be that as ft 
may, none of the chapters are «iuIL 
and some are <|uite stimulating. " 
Fate readers will have encountered 
several of these stories previously 
while others will be new. 

The two most interesting seetf**\ 
both by R. S. Lambert, are u* 
opening account of American In* , 
dtan shamanism and the externM 
story of the Amherst poltergeist 
case. Both, incidently, illustrate the 
way in which documentation can 
make the recounting of paranormal 
phenomena more convincing and 
more interesting. If one regrets that 
all the sections were not equally^ 
documented, it still remains that the' 
Singers have gone much further in 
this direction than the overwhelm- 
ing majority of simitar compilations 
This might be an ideal volume for 
the person who is making the tran- 
sition from "ghost stories" as pur* 
entertainment to a more serious 
interest in payohie phenomena.**

Podmore regretted that to trm 
statistics ware available, but admits 
ted that those which were showed 
conclusively that faith-healing and 
mental science were effective in 
cases where hypnotism would be 
effective, and failed where hypn* 
dam also failed. “In others wonK* 
he says, “in all alike the effect 
would appear to be due to supce*. 
tion; and it has not yet been proved 
that any one of the recognized 
modes of imparting the suggestion 
is conspicuously more effective than 
another.* 9 * 

Yet, as Eric 3* Dingwall says is 
Ms Introduction to this book, “Whea 
all is said and done, the divem 
explanations suggest that an accu* 
rate description of what is actually 
occurring still eludes us, Withis v 
ourselves there seems to be a power, 
which can, given the necessary con* 
ditions, heal those maladies respon- 
sive to that influence while at the 
same time the limits of that power 
are, in the present state of our 
knowledge, impossible to define." 

Podmore tries to get to the root

sf this unknown power by analys- 
ing carefully much of the written 
material about the earlier mesmer- 
ists, not only of their healings but 
af their interesting experiences with 
clairvoyants and sensitives. Then 
be discusses the period in which the 
techniques were taken up and modi* 
Ged by doctors such as Elliotson 
and Esdaile, and later Braid, who 
Coined the name hynotism. 

^ The discovery of ether and chloro* 
farm led to the rejection of hyno* 
tism in medicine for many decades, 
tad during this period Spiritualism 
took a firm hold on the minds of 
the time. It was discovered, accord* 
tog to Podmore, that clairvoyants 
could put themselves into receptive 
states with the aid of magnetism or 
hypnotism. They even found them* 
selves able to impart healing on oc« 
easion. Andrew Jackson Davis and 
Thomas Lake Harris carried this a 
step forward, and then came what 
F. W % H. Myers calls “the other 
schemes of self-suggestion 99 such a a 
X«w Thought and Christian Science. 
Fhincaa T. Quimby originated the 
totter name and many of Its tenets. 
These were later adopted, amplified

FROM MfSMEft TO CHRISTIAN SCIENCE by 
Fraftk Pedtoore* Uowenify looks. Now Hydo 
Pork, NX. 1903. 30d pogot, 810-00. 

Frank Podmore, a member of th« 
Society for Psjxhical Research from 
Its earliest days, has long been 
known as the devil’* advocate of 
this field. Therefore, in From Mt* 
mtr to Christian Sctewco, originally 
published in 1909, it is rather sur* 
prising to see him take a firm stand 
in favor of something so elusive as 
mental healing. But he reserves the 
right to his own interprstation of 
how it works* 

After a penetrating analysis of 
the life and techniques of Anton 
Mesmer and some of his lesser* 
known followers — Deslon, de Puy* 
segur, Deleute, Alexander Bertrand 
and others — Podmore says, "But 
the question which will most inter* 
est the practical man is, *Do the 
mental healers heal? 4 Unquestion* 
ably they do." 

Yet he rejects the Idea that the 
actual causes of the cures are rays, 
conduction by iron, streams of 
light, magnetic crises, or any of 
the whole machinery on which ear* 
lier writers relied as demonstrating 
the existence of a healing fluid-* 
celestial, magnetic or electric. He 
agrees instead with Bertrand’s con- 
clusions that the "results were .due 
to the imagination of the subject, 
pretcr*normally alive to the least 
suggestion, by word, look, gesture,

!ng our own, substantial resources 
are devoted to the detection of in. 
terstellar radio transmissions, 
rum ably sent by intelligent life— 
our “Project Oxma n is one example. 
Hour after hour, gigantic parabofoh 
dal radio telescopes probe the heav- 
ens, seeking for the faint whisper a! 
a radio signal in which order ran 
be detected, a signal probably buried 
in the eternal rustling and noise of 
the endless energy of 21 centimeter 
waves. 

The idea of communication across 
Interstellar distances /was far. 
fetched as recently as a few yean 
ago. Transmitters could not hurl a 
tight enough beam of radiation- 
light or any other electromagnetic 
wave— into space without it vend- 
ing in its own spreading. With *lt 
invention of the “maser* and the 
“laser* (light amplification by the 
stimulation of electromagnetic ra- 
diation) the “beaming barrier* wat 
broken. It is now possible to visual* 
he our lancing into apace with such 
a tight beam of radiation that 
enough would remain to bo detect* 
ible, even after a journey of light* 
years. 

In a fascinating manner. .the book 
discusses the coding one might ex* 
pect to receive or transmit, coding 
that could readily be differentiated 
from the random noise that permt* 
ates all ^signaling. 

The writers of these papers art 
not particularly optimistic. The 
probability of the Earth being struck 
by an alien signal is remote. But to 
a man, these physicists insist that 
the hope is worth the effort no mat- 
ter how little promising. And all 
those of us who are fascinated by the 
concept of extra-terrestrial life will 
agree— and for that reason will find 
the book enjoyable and rewarding

C* W. A Itftjaiftta* l«Cn Myt 

310 p tyi , «• pw it^i 

A book with A title like the Aboro 
Abound to bo cantivating. But it is 
v>: for the faint-hearted. Richly 
5 D«d with descriptive passages on 
h subject, it is also well-laced with 
mathematical notions and physical 
asneepta that require more than a 
tUnc* to understand. With an eye 
capable of selective skipping, an 
mterested reader will find the im- 
sginative idea "is there other life 
ai the Universe?" discussed aa pro* 
vaically aa hardware for the next 
missile shoot. So fast has technology 
taken us! 

While the author has contributed 
wreral papers to the book 'aa well 
*s an introduction, this is really an 
mthology of scientific papers taken 
from scientific journals such as 
Science, Nature, Proceedings of the 
Institute of Radio Engineer*, and 
even the Russian Priroda. A few 
titles will suggest the depth and 
catholicity of the treatment, "Search 
for Artificial Stellar Sources of In* 
fra-Red Radiation" by Dyson: note 
that word "artificial” Or "Detec- 
tion of Intelligent “Signals from 
Space,” by Webb, Or, "Some Poten- 


tialities of Optical Masers (lasers) ** 
by Oliver, 

This is not science-fiction nor is 
it the imaginative filler so frequent- 
ly used by the "gee-whi*. ain’t science 
wonderful” type of magaiine. 
Starting with a dispassionate 
study of the probability of finding 
life in our vast galactic system, 
these papers proceed in an orderly' 
fashion to consider the variety of in- 
telligence levels possible (probable, „ 
is the better word) and then go or 
to consider the nature of commu^M 
cation with this conceivable life, 

Radio or visual communication 
between Earth and other life in the 
Solar System has been possible for 
the past 100 years. Regrettably, the 
writers conclude that if there la 
extra-terrestrial life. It is not likely 
to be found in the Solar System 
save In a very low form— in short 
without intelligence. 

Until the last 20 yatra, the papers 
continue, the hope of Interstellar 
communication, that is the reception 
of signals from the inhabitants of 
the nearer stars, was hopeless. But 
the rapid advances In radio-astron- 
omy, along with the development of 
super-sensitive receivers and ampli- 
fiers, have changed all this, 4

the team and buggy far to the ** 
of the road to allow them room *

This seemed strange as normCy 
both hearse and horses were black. 
As the hearse drew abreast tf 
Grandpa’s buggy his team became 
frightened and shied partly out b- 
to the road. The hearse and horvs 
galloped right through GrmndpA 
team. Both Grandma and Grandpa 
saw and heard this apparition. 

Grandpa was very sad after it had 
passed and told Grandma that some- 
one in his family had died. 

A few days later they receive: 
news that his mother’s sister had 
died on the very night they had 
seen the hearse. 

My grandfather had many suA 
experiences even during the yearly 
I knew him. As far as I know he' 
always received a warning he fort 
the death of a member of his family. 
At one time it whs a black coffin 
floating just outside the window. 
He also received warnings not con- 
nected with death. At one time he 
was warned of a fire which de- 
stroyed his home and. due to hit 
foreknowledge, he was able to save 
the lives of four of his children it 
this fire.— P/arcrm7/c, Calif*

area surrounding the house. He 
could ace hit lifeless body where it

by the bedside. The details of what 
he reported seeing on the outside j 
proved to be true beyond any ita* ^

Grandfather Armour explained N 
further that the* pain of returning, : 
to his body was greater than any : 
he ever had experienced in life. Hr ^ 
said it was not a physical pain V-* 
the mental pain of regret for return , , 
ing from his new-found* complete ?

The actions and reaction at the , 
bedside indicated that Grandfather**

Like most subjects, witchcraft

irr dark sides. I* have tried to 
Trite fairly and factually. The dis- 
jaclTon between white and black 
ritchcraft should not be lost sight 

JU is the distinction of methods 
nd of motives. White magic and 
(hite witchcraft seek to serve some 
ro&d purpose. Black magic and 
black witchcraft seek to corrupt and 
degrade, to grab, dominate and ex*

. r Apart from the question of white

ground, witchcraft is basically the 
pre-Christian “Old Religion", the 
worship of the forces of life and 
fertility, and the knowledge and use 
of the secret powers of nature. Cerew 
monial magic, on the other 
especially the magic of the 
called Grimoires, fa within either a 
Jewish or Christian cabalistic 
framework. 

An exception to this latter rule, , 
however is the system used by the 
magical order known as the Golden 
Dawn. This association was found- 
ed by S. L. MacGregor Mathers, 
Dr. Williams Woodman. Dr. Wynn 
Westcott, in 18S7, from Rosicro* - 
dan sources. It has been the par- , 
ent body of most serious magical i 
orders of modern times. 

Its system seeks to harmonise 
the cabalistic magic with the in- 
vocation of the ancient gods. - T < s

DREAM OF DEATH

Mrs. Noman Cain of Lebanon, Ind H one morning recently. 

a . a ^ 4kA lamei 


She rushed to her daughter's crib and found that the baby was 
not breathing. When mouth-fco-mouth resuscitation efforts failed, 
the baby was taken to the hospital, where doctors gave the cause 
of her death as pneumonia. y \ 


[| I, freely than in London. A peculiar 
v feature of its architecture is that 
it possesses a great many under- 
ground tunnels and passages in the 
older parts of the town. Some of 
these were possibly natural caves, 
j improved upon by the fanastic 
i taste of Georgian and Regency 
builders. A persistent local tradition 
states that some of these tunnels 
| have at times been used for secret 
;] meetings. 

Some time ago a secret room was 
found in a village not far from 
Brighton. Some workmen were do- 
ing alterations to an old house there 
and had occasion to dig in the 
grounds. They found a circular un- 
j derground room, exactly nine feet 
.< in diameter; This is the traditional 
: j dimension of a magic circle. I be- 
j lieve a tunnel connected it to the 

* house. 

In times past many people of all 
ranks in society practiced the oc- 
cult am. This secret cell may well 
have been used for some such end 
if. by a previous occupant of the « 
| house. A candle to provide light, a 
if brazier of hot coals to provide heat 
| and to burn incense, and a ventila- 
I lion shaft, would have been all that 
.* was necessary to make it ideal for 
;; the purpose. 

If ; Alternatively, of course, it may 

* have been a "priest’s hole”, a relic . 
of the days of religious persecu- 
tion. But why go to the trouble of 
making it* a nine-foot circle? 


fate 

That famous and controvert 
figure, Aleister Crowley, who 
ied in the title of "The Beast 606* 
(he even had it printed on his vfa 
iting-cardst), spent the last two 
years of his life at Hastings. He 
died there on December !, 1947^ 
aged 72. His remains were cremated 
at Brighton on December S, and 
the ashes sent to his disciples fa 
America. 

The ritual which took place at 
his cremation caused protests to 
Brighton Town Council. It consist- 
ed of his Hymn to Pen, and some 
extracts from The Book of the Lrs 
and his Cnottie Moss. These were 
read from the rostrum of the cre- 
matorium chapel, while a congre- 
gation, mainly of his followers and 
friends, gathered about his flower- 
covered coffin. 

Present also, but in his official 
capacity, was Superintendent Rob- 
ert Fabian, of Scotland Yard. He 
tells of this occasion in an article 
he wrote after his retirement, in the 
Sunday Graphic, June 10, 1956. He 
states that, observing the congrega- 
tion, he was able to identify lead- 
ing members of known black magic 
circles in London, and also in the 
neighboring towns of Lewes and 
Sho reham. He also mentions this 
in his book London After Pork. 

There was a rumor in Brighton 
that some difficulty had been ex- 
perienced in carrying out the cre- 
mation. It was alleged that certain 




The police found a quantity of 
literature upon black magic in his 
possession. 

Aponte desired to retrain the 
love of a former woman friend, who 
had left him. For this purpose he 
wanted a human victim as the su- 
preme sacrifice to evil spirits. 

Aponte confessed that he killed 
his victim by striking him a blow 
upon the back of the head and then 
strangling him with a cord. He bur- 
| ied the body under the dirt floor in 
his home. Seven months later he 
dog up the body, cut off the head, 
and carefully dried it in a stove. 
Then he performed a hideous ritual 
with a lock of hair from the head of 
the woman he desired, placing it 
within the skull of the sacrifice. 

Six psychiatrists gave evidence 
at the preliminary hearing in the 
Aponte case. Aponte was found to 
be sane and sent for trial, charged 
with murder. The Press cutting I 
have of the case is from the Sun- 
4*y Pictorial, dated October 5. 
1*58. 

Black magic sometimes involves 
the desecration of churches and 
cemeteries. I have been told of two 
alleged instances in which churches 
In Sussex were desecrated by having 
black magic rituals performed in 
them by intruders in the night. 
Another allegation I have heard in- 
volved the use of a Sussex grave- 
I*"* foe * black magic ritual. The 
body of a'cockerd was said to have 


been found lying in a pool of Wood 
on an old flat tombstone, which 
bad been used as an improvised 
altar. 

I could get no proof of these *1. 
legations; but they are in keeping 
with black magic beliefs. The idea 
Involved is that more power is given 
to a ritual if it is performed on 
consecrated ground. 

A horrible scandal of graveyard/ 
desecrated for black magic broke 
out in Finland in the autumn o( 
1931. Portions of a number of 
human bodies were found in a well 
near Helsingfors. The police at first 
feared that they had a case of mass- 
murder. However, their investiga- 
tions and the medical evidence soon 
led them to abandon this theory. 
Instead, they began to suspect 
they were dealing with black magic. 

Their suspicions led them to the 
caretaker of a municipal mortuary, 
a man named Saarenheimo. They 
began exhumations in the cemetery, 
where bodies which had * 

through Saarenheimo’s mortuary 
bad been interred. They found that 
over 40 of the bodies they exhumed 
had been mutilated in various ways. 

Saarenheimo was arrested. The 
police searched his lodgings and 
found literature on necromancy and 
black magic, together with some 
incriminating letters. One of the 
treatises on black magic was in 
English. Another book was de>' 
scribed as "an old Swedish ‘Black 


MODERN* BLACK MAGIC 
jjdtV"- This sounds like a Grim- 

At. * f 

His neighbors told police that 
jtsterious meetings had been tak- 
n place at night at the mortuary 
far nearly two years past. It was 
ylieved that a black magic frater* 
«ty of considerable sitt was in- 
wived, possibly even on an inter- 
ational scale, 

„ Saarenheimo, in custody, fre- 
quently spent his time chanting 
cabalistic words. Meanwhile, the 
police continued their grim investi- 
gation. Great public concern had 
been aroused, especially in those 
families who feared that their dead 
bad been outraged. Many persons 
mre interrogated but no further 
arrests were made; though it seemed 
evident that Saarenheimo was not 
stone in this horrible affair, 
s As a result of this case die 
Church authorities made careful in- 
vestigations at all parish mortuar- 
ies throughout Finland, to prevent 
any possibility of a recurrence of 
iSaarenheimo's crimes. 

’V The facts from which the above 
account is taken were published in 
The Times on October 7, 9 and 14, 
1931. 

As to the purpose of these dese- 
crations, there are many recorded 
;black magic rituals which require 
.human blood, candles of human 
<fat, or lamps fed with oil made from 
’human fat. Human bones, human 
skin, and parts of bodies have been 


used In black magic spells. The 
Act of Parliament passed by James 
I against witchcraft in 1603 also 
included a special provision against 
those who robbed graveyards for 
the honid needs of black magic, 

Another horrible story came fror^B 
Spain in 1920, and was reported in 
The Times on September 27 of that 
year, under the heading: "Human 
Vampires". A young girl who was 
minding sheep in the province of 
Estremadura had been found mur- 
dered. Her body had been drained 
of blood and mutilated of several 
organs. At the time when this oc- 
curred the Madrid police were al- 
ready investigating the similar 
death of a little boy. Both deaths . 
•were attributed to practicers of 
black magic. 1 

The Times correspondent com- 
mented that in spite of several se* ^ 
vere penalties recently imposed ^ 
upon what he called “witch doc-^ 
tors", fanaticism and superstition 
still preyed upon the people of re- 
mote villages, and human blood had 
still Its price. 

So muck far the glib dismissals 
of those who try to persuade «s 
that black magic does not exist l 

That well-known writer on black * 
magic, the late Montague Summers, '% 
always insisted that there was a 
secret black magic center in Brigh- 
ton. Brighton was a favorite resort 
for Regency 'bucks’, who could in- 
dulge themselves there even more

I Thd area whew they were found is 
one of derelict buildings, near a 
I railway station. 

T An R.S.P.CA. inspector is quot- 
ed as saving, "Whoever killed those 
poor cats must have had warped 
minds. The manner of the deaths 
suggested that whoever did it was 
carrying out a ritual of being 
daubed with blood, such as would 
happen, I suppose, if a person was 
being initiated into a secret so- 
ciety.** 

I have heard a first-hand ac* 
V' count, from a young man in Bright- 
on, of a black magic ceremony 
which involved the ritual use of 
the blood of a cat. This young man, 
incidentally, is a different person 
from my informant of the previous 
storyi 

He told me how, a few years 
before, .he had been doing his Na- 
j tional Service. He became friendly 
f with another young National Serv- 
iceman whose people kept a large 
public-house in the country. His 
new friend asked him if he would 
like to spend their next short leave 
with him there. 

A country pub sounded attrac- 
tive, so he agreed. Everything 
seemed perfectly normal. The pre- 
V mises were large and well appoint- 
ed. One large upstairs room, he was 
told, was reserved for private par- 
ties. | f 

During the night he got up and 
, went down a few stairs to the 


FATE 

toilet. He noticed that a party 
seemed to be in progress in the 
large room. Being on leave he was 
not averse to a bit of fun so, instead 
of returning to his bedroom, he de- 
cided to peep around the door 
where the party was taking place, 
to see if it looked lively. Frankly, 
he said, he was hoping they’d in- 
vite him in for a drink. Tf, how- 
ever, it seemed a formal affair, he 
intended to slip off again without 
them seeing him. 

Being in slippers and dressing- 
gown, he moved quietly. He opened 
the door of the room without being 
noticed, and looked around. He 
found that he had gate-crashed a 
very odd “party* indeed. 

All the lights were turned out 
and the room was lit only by can- 
dles. Standing round in the gloom 
were men and women wearing dark 
robes and masks. In the center of 
the room was a kind of altar, wittt 
incense burning upon it Through 
the incense smoke he could make 
out a weird figure standing behind 
the altar. It was that of a tall man, 
dressed in a black robe embroid- 
ered on the breast with cabalistic 
signs. The man’s face and head 
were covered by a horned, goat-like 
mask. 

Completely astonished the young 
man just stood and stared. Some- 
one spotted him. Quickly he was 
grabbed, pinioned, and pulled in- 
side the room. There was a mo- 


‘ MODERN BLACK MAGIC 
, ' ■ } 

ment of confusion as the partici- 

.'pants realized they had a spy 
among them. Then the goat-masked 
leader told him that, as he had 
| come so far, there was nothing for 
'ft but for him to join the black 
coven and take the oath. 

•*» Although he was in the Forces 
he was just a teenager and by now 
thoroughly scared. He realized that 
to make an outcry was useless. In 
..spite of the robe and mask, he had 
recognized his friend’s mother, the 
^proprietress, among those present. 

, So, with his arms firmly pinioned 
•hy two men, he submitted to the 
v grotesque ritual. 

> He was brought to the altar and 
made to take a frightening oath of 
loyalty and silence. A black cat 
was killed upon the altar as a ritual 
sacrifice, and his face and wrists 
were daubed with Its blood. They 
gave him a cup of some dark wine 
to drink. It was strong and evident- 
ly laced with a drug, as he says 
that after taking it his recollection 
of what followed is hasy and con- 
fused. 

- He awoke the next morning back 
in his bed. He could have believed 
the whole occurrence a fantastic 
dream except that upon his face 
and wrists were traces of dried 
blood. 

v * He did not know if his friend 
.knew about it or not. If not, he had 
'.®° wish to tell him. Anyway, who 
-would believe him? In the end, be 


decided to say nothing. His leave 
was up and he had to return to his 
unit that morning. So he jm» 
packed his bag. and left as 1 

he could. All he wanted was Htt 
away. He had put the expe^mce 
out of his mind, and never spoken 
of it to anyone. 

There was a time when I dis- , 
missed stories of black magic, in- 
volving blood sacrifices and even 
whispers of human sacrifice, as 
nonsense dreamed up by journal- 
ists in the silly season, to sell their 
papers. I no longer do so. "< 

An indisputable instance of 
black magic ritual involving human , It 
sacrifice occurred recently in Amer- 
ica. A man from Puerto Rico, Juan 
Aponte, 46 years old, worked on a’

One day he was arrested on a minw \l 
charge, and confessed to a murJpi ; 

His victim was a 13-year-old J 
boy, Roger Carlotto, who had then . : 
been missing for some time. Roger * ;

Outwardly, Aponte was a normal, 
respectable citizen. Secretly, he was 
a student of black magic and voo* v

Some details of the magic drcle

canvas, are given in the account - 
of his preliminary trial. It Is recog- 
nizable as the one depicted by 
Eliphas Levi as the “Goetic Circle * -

I HAVE REMARKED previous- 
ly that anyone who denies the 
present-day existence of black magic 
is either simply ignorant of the 
facts, or is trying to conceal the 
truth for his own ends. Some sig- 
nificant stories from the national 
Press may give the reader food for 
thought. 

Not long ago three young busi- 
nessmen took a flat together in 
Nottingham. The house in which 
the flat was situated had previous- 
ly been empty for some time. The 


new tenants of the flat happened 
to go exploring in the basement. 
To their surprise, beneath the cel- 
lar they found another cellar. 

Here, carefully painted upon the 
walls, were weird and fantastic fig- 
ures. One was of a blood-stained 
hand. Others were of devil’s heads. 
An upturned box, stained red, 
seemed to have been used as a 
kind of altar. It was caked with the 
drippings of candles. 

Rather shaken, one of them told 
the story to a reporter for a Not- 


Cots ora important elements in secret occult ceremonies. 
Is that why their mutilated bodies are being found today*

tingham newspaper. The reporter 
./->asked him if he thought it could 
have been done as a joke. He re- 
spited that he thought the drawings 
were too well done, and too much 
^trouble had been taken with them. 
’^Besides, surely a cellar beneath a 
^cellar was an odd place to play 
/jokes? 

The paintings appeared to have 
*" been done recently. Had the arrival 
. of the new tenants disturbed some 
“-person or persons who had been 
; using the empty house for strange 

* rituals? 

f T I mention this story because, un- 
known to him, it bears a. remark- 
wable similarity to one told me by a 
, Brighton man. He and another man 
Lonce stayed overnight in a rented 

* room in a tumbledown old house 
in Brighton. They were rather 

4' hard-up at the time, and glad to 
^ get a cheap lodging. However, one 
j? night in this particular place was 
enough for them. 

y They had to share the squalid 
,'S.room. They tried to sleep; but as 
t- the night wore on an increasing 

* sense of fear and strangeness came 
'/over them. The room was invaded 
iby a chilliness which seemed some- 
thing other than mere cold. Final- 
ly, the atmosphere of unearthly evil 
v became so intense that they could 
'Tstand it no longer. They got up and 
^dressed, and resolved quietly to 
jS explore. Anything was better than 
^remaining still in that weird place. 


They crept downstairs to the 
kitchen. All was normal; there 
seemed no visible reason for their 
fears. Then, greatly daring, they 
decided to venture farther, to a 
cellar-like room below. 

They looked in and upon the ba^*/* 1 *^ 
floor they found the obvious 
mains of some occult ritual. Th^r 
were "queer chalked signs" drawn 
on the floor and the burned-down - . 
remains of black candles. , 

They returned to their room and 
sat up with the light on to wait the 
dawn. In the morning they left as 
soon as they could. 

The house in question bad a dis- 
reputable clientele, mostly from the \ 
fringe of the underworld. I had an • 
opportunity, when it became vac- 1 
ant, of entering it. Apart from its , 
dinginess and squalor it certainly \ ' 
had a most unpleasant atmosphere. 

I can only describe it as a feeling 
that one was being watched by^~ 4 
something vicious. 

My informant, who had some^^ 
knowledge of the occult, firmly be- f 
lieved that a ritual must have been - 
performed there shortly before he 
and his friend had their uncanny 
experience; and that some evil <n- tl . J 
tity attracted by this ritual was the 
cause of their terror. 

The Sunday Empbt News, on 
November 1, 1959, the day after 
Hallowe’en, reported that the mutil- ;

a friend. From experience I know 
that three travelers seldom are con- 
genial — two, four or more — but 
never three. I did not object, how- 
ever, as I saw a perfect medium for 
testing my mental capacity for al- 
tering the 'material pattern. The 
third member of our party was very 
enthusiastic about going and com- 
pleted preparations for the trip; he 
was all ready to go, almost right up 
to the hour of departure. I said no 
word of objection. But, in my mind, 
I gave a command that something 
would come up to prevent his ac- 
companying us. There was nothing 
personal in this. Actually, I liked 
the young man but I did not like 
the idea of three traveling some 
400 miles into the wilderness. At 
the very last minute, I received a 
telephone call from the young man. 
He was unhappy and apologetic: he 
said he could not go; his parents 
did not approve. 

This lone instance would not 
prove anything. However, the same 
sort of thing was repeated less than 
six months’ later. The first Olympic 
Peninsula petroglyph hunt had been 
so successful that a second was 
undertaken. For this second trip, 
another young, studious college stu- 
dent would go with me. He, like- 
wise, desired to take atong a friend. 
Again, by force of thought on my 
part, the proposed third member of 
our little expedition was caused to 
back out at the rero hour! 


FATE I ^CONTROLLED BRUSH WITH DEATH 


Now, as our yellow hardtop hur- 
tled the intervening 13 feet between 
the point of visual interception and 
physical impact, three thoughts dy- 
namically occupied my complete 
mental spectrum. First and fore- 
most, I gave the command that no 
one involved in this unavoidable ac- 
cident (insofar as my wife and I 
were concerned) would be seriously 
injured— no blood would be spiU* 
ed. This command leaped from my 
brain like a magnetic force. I could 
feel it project from my hypothala- 
mus cortex like a pencil of powerful - 
light. 

My second thought was translat- 
ed into lightning kinesthesis. The 
hurtling black car wfcs in the air, 
wheels some three feet off the pave- 
ment. In my imagination, I saw our 
collision: the blade car literally 
rolling over us, crushing my wife 
and me in our seats. The idea that 
I must spear this death vehicle 
flashed through my mind, spear it 
as one would spear a salmon dart- 
ing through the turbulent stream. 
In the split-second time allotted, I 
pulled right on the wheel, just a 
fraction. But it was sufficient for 
the right headlight of my yellow 
hardtop to impale the black car 
so thoroughly that, later, mechanics 
called to the scene of the accident 
had to use considerable 'force In 
order to seperate the two locked 
vehicles. 

My third thought, galvanized into 

... . .. it 


Instantaneous (seemingly Involun- 
tary) action, prevented my wife 
from being pitched through the 
windshield. My right hand, like a 
'rise, grasped a handful of her coat 
and held rigid. My wife escaped 
with two bruised knees and a nasty 
bump on the head where she con- 
nected with the rearview mirror. 
But she suffered, otherwise, not so 
much as a scratch. In fact, even her 
nylon hose were unrun! 

>• When I glanced back, after the 
sound of the terrific impact had 
died away and I had seen that my 
wife did not appear to be serious- 
ly injured, I was amazed to see a 
third car rammed right into the 
back of our yellow hardtop. There 
had not been any sensation of a 
.second impact. This third car, as 
if answering my mental command, 
"had swept up, at the last instant, 
‘•and had absorbed much of the im« 
’pact, had prevented us from bounc- 
jng, an often-fatal result of two- 
■car crashes. 

■W- Police on the scene of the acci- 
' dent were positively amazed to 
Tfind no one badly hurt. They found 
'not one drop of blood. Officer Rob- 
ertson, of the Portland City Police 
:Department, commented, “This is 
Fa miracle." Later, insurance ad- 
justers scarcely could reconcile the 

m- • 


wrecked condition of the can with 
the lack of persona) injury to those 
involved. 

Seventeen-year-old Jim Timblln, 
alone in the spectral black car, was j 
knocked unconscious. But he suf- * 
fered no other injury. He was re- 
leased from the hospital within an 
hour after emergency admittance. 
At midnight his mother told me 
over the telephone, with great 
thankfulness. M Oh, the boy’s all 
right. He’s out in the kitchen get- 
ting something to eat, I think . .

alone in the car behind us, calmly 
climbed out of his badly damaged 
1952 Ford sedan and helped direct 
traffic.

knowledge of the physical features^ 
of this accident considers it miracu- 
lous, By the law of averages, there 
should have been at least one seri- 
ously injured person, perhaps a 
death; there should have been cuts 
and bleeding. But, except for the 
headlights, there was no broken 
- glass at alll Not even the side 
windows of the black car were 
shattered and it was rammed 
broadside. : j '

nr H ROUGH THE operation of a

On Easter-eve, 1961, my wife 
Ella and I were on our way to a

some rain was falling. We drove 
our yellow hardtop across town un-

\ This ridicule of the new, the 
strange, and the unusual has led to 
tragedy for many of those who see 
the possibilities, who try to de- 
velop new inventions, new methods, 
and to present new scientific 
knowledge. Some of these practical 
visionaries simply have not had the 
stamina to endure the ridicule and 
the jibes. 

' ! Diesel leaped from an airplane 
into the English Channel. His last 
note stated that he did cot mind 
the impending bankruptcy that be 
faced but he could not endure the 
taunts and laughter any longer. 
Vet the Diesel engine is probably 
the only invention that ever went 
directly from the drawing board 
into production. 

' i Langley’s aeroplane actually was 
taken from the Smithsonian In* 
stitute and flown with a gasoline 
engine years after Langley’s death. 
Possibly Langley did not take bis 
own life but every biographer agrees 
that ridicule killed him. 

! Few have the stamina to endure 
the persecution that Robert H. 
Goddard received from his fellow 
faculty members who accused him 
of bringing the name of their uni* 
versity into disrepute by his experi- 
ments with the liquid-fueled rocket. 


FATE 

He was arrested and threatened 
with jail in his native state for dis- 
turbing the peace by setting off his 
rockets. Finally he fled with his 
drawings to the Southwest where 
in that sparcely settled part of the 
United States he found people who, 
if they did not agree with him, did 
not laugh. 

The sheer persistence of men like 
Gail Borden, father of the evap- 
orated milk industry is amazing. 
When he tried to find a method of 
preserving meat the United States 
Government threatened prosecution, 
claiming some soldiers had been 
made ill by the concoction. His 
“preserved soup” was alleged to 
have killed two babies en route on 
a ship from Europe. He was hooted 
out of Texas as a common nuisance. 
In Upper New York state he experi- 
mented with evaporated milk, using 
a canning device borrowed from a 
Shaker colony. When no one would 
buy canned milk he was reduced' to 
peddling the evaporated milk in 
pails from door to door. House- 
wives finally bought when they 
found it would not sour as quicklv 
as fresh milk. When the- Civil War 
broke out the Quartermaster Gen- 
eral sent a representative to call on 
Gail Borden. One can of the con- 
densed milk was still on the shelves. 
It was more than a year old tut 
it was all right, it had kept. Bor- 
den was in business! 

Some innovators are just lucky.

V Social changes, such as the de-

^ribald jokes. 

New ideas are strictly for laughs.

he did not. Actually, he safe****

pioneers had received the same 
sort of treatment. When priorities 
were announced for the first time 
under Hitler rockets were given a 
priority just above bathtubs for 
private homes. 

If the history of ridicule b any 
criterion for success, and it would 
seem to be, investors would do well 
to abandon financial advisors and 
find out what people are laughing 
at today and put their money in 
that. For what men sneer at to- 
day, they buy, manufacture, and 
use tomorrow.

announced the coining of the auto-

had cut off all importation of sugar 
from the West Indies -where sugar 
cane furnished the sole known

so effective that people in France

There is nothing new in the story 
except the incident itself. Every
